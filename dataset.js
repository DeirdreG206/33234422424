Our mission is to lead the way to end Alzheimer's and all other dementia — by accelerating global research, driving risk reduction and early detection, and maximizing quality care and support. Our vision is a world without Alzheimer’s and all other dementia. \n\nFrom chapters and offices across the U.S., including a home office in Chicago and a public policy office in Washington, D.C., the Alzheimer’s Association continues to lead breakthrough research and a new era of quality care for those impacted by Alzheimer’s and other dementia, so that all communities are included as we drive closer toward cures. \n\nWith Alzheimer’s Association leadership, in the next decade we will see: \n\n⮚ Individuals across all communities routinely take action to promote brain health, reduce risk, and prevent dementia; \n⮚ Widespread screening, diagnosis, quality care, and effective treatments for all stages of disease become accessible to everyone; and\n⮚ Clinical symptoms can be slowed, stopped and even prevented. \n\nWe're the global leader in Alzheimer’s and all other dementia research. We're the world’s largest nonprofit funder of Alzheimer’s research and the nonprofit with the highest impact in Alzheimer’s research worldwide. Active Alzheimer’s Association commitments totaling $430 million are powering more than 1,150 best-of-field projects in 57 countries to achieve progress in Alzheimer’s treatment, prevention, early detection, risk reduction and care. \n\nWe're the largest Alzheimer’s advocacy organization in the world. Working with and through the Alzheimer’s Impact Movement (AIM), a separately incorporated advocacy affiliate of the Association, we led the call to increase federal funding for dementia research to more than $3.8 billion annually — a more than seven-fold increase over the past 10 years. \n\nWe're the global leader in providing and promoting quality care and support. In 2024, more than 567,000 individuals received a direct care service or participated in an education program, support group or early-stage program at more than 15,000 points of service across the country.

A level one consultation typically is conducted via Helpline and focuses on one or two areas of need. A level two consultation is a scheduled meeting with a chapter care consultant who conducts a full assessment of a family's needs and provides a written action plan.\n⮚ Support groups - people with early-stage dementia and caregivers learn about the disease, and discuss feelings and concerns in a confidential and supportive environment with a trained facilitator.\n⮚ Education programs - we provide education covering all aspects of Alzheimer's for people with dementia, their caregivers, professional care providers and the public. Programs include &quot;10 Warning Signs,&quot; &quot;Healthy Living for Brain & Body,&quot; &quot;Empowered Caregiver&quot; and &quot;New Advances in Alzheimer's Treatment.&quot;\n⮚ Information and referral - people who call our 24/7 Helpline speak with a trained consultant who can help with decision-making, crisis assistance, and education on issues that families face every day. Callers are referred to local resources and chapter staff provide follow-up as needed.\n\nWe can't help those who don't know about us. One of the key ways we extend our reach is by building alliances and mobilizing volunteers to meet people where they live, work, play and pray. We partner with local community leaders, influencers and organizations to open doors, identify community needs, and meet and mobilize volunteers. We recruit, train and equip these volunteers to promote brain health, raise awareness of resources for the dementia journey, and deliver education programs. \n\nWith more people, we are reaching more people who need us.

Connecting to quality dementia care shouldn’t be – especially now that we have new treatments. More than 7 million Americans are living with dementia, yet many do not receive consistent, high-quality, coordinated care. Families often have to navigate these complexities on their own, leading to poor outcomes, high rates of hospitalization and emergency room visits, and significant caregiver stress.\n\nDiagnosis is an important first step toward getting appropriate treatment, care, and social support. As new treatments are approved, early detection and accurate diagnosis are even more critical for ensuring people receive the most benefit at the earliest point. In an Alzheimer’s Association survey, 8 in 10 primary care physicians who care for older adults reported it is difficult to diagnose Alzheimer’s in the earliest symptomatic stage -- and half usually do not feel comfortable diagnosing it. Seventy percent \nof caregivers surveyed by the Association say care coordination is stressful, and six in 10 health care workers say the health care system is not helping patients.\n\nIn partnership with Rippl Care (Rippl), an innovative telehealth company in Washington, we began offering Dementia Care Navigation in four states including Washington.

Each Protégé is paired with a carefully selected mentor who provides guidance and assistance in achieving their unique career goals. This year-long mentorship is expertly facilitated by dedicated Operations Associates, ensuring a meaningful and impactful journey for both Mentors and Protégés. ACP's innovative approach to mentorship creates lasting connections that empower Veterans to thrive in the civilian workforce. Protégés discuss various employment topics, including career exploration, résumé writing, networking, and successful job acclimation. More than 38,000 veterans and military spouses have completed the program, stating that ACP has had a life-changing impact upon their transition. ACP was Founded in 2008 by retired investment banker Sidney E. Goodfriend, who continues to helm the organization as its Chairman of the Board. Goodfriend has invested several hundred thousand dollars of personal funds to start and grow ACP and has never taken a salary for his efforts.\n\nIn 2024, 83% of applicants were enlisted service members and 17% were officers, with a median Veteran age of 38. Gender breakdown among Veterans was 76% male and 23% female. Active-Duty Military Spouses constituted 9% of the program, 92% of whom identified as women. In 2024, ACP’s Protege population was 24% Black/African American, 15% Hispanic, 7% Asian/Pacific Islander, 2% Native American, and 5% Other/Omitted. Additionally, 42% of Protégés had less than a four-year degree, and 36% identified as having an invisible service-connected wound.\n\nCorporate volunteers pledge an hour a month to the program, totaling 60,000+ hours a year.

Wockner Foundation will enable expansion of ACP's program in the Pacific Northwest (PNW) to include an additional 25-30 veterans or active duty military spouses. With a waiting list of veterans, this funding will be put to use right away to recruit additional volunteer corporate mentors and fund the increased caseloads of ACP's Operations Associates who pair each applicant by hand, follow up with each participant throughout the year, and track progress/metrics, while also troubleshooting any communication issues which may arise during the mentorship. At the heart of ACP's mission is a commitment to individualized support. Each Veteran and Military Spouse (called Protégés) is paired with a carefully selected Mentor who provides guidance and assistance in achieving their unique career goals.\n\nOver the last five years, ACP has experienced significant and sustained growth in demand for its services. Applications to our mentorship program have increased by 136%, reflecting the growing need among transitioning service members, Veterans, and Military Spouses for career support. With approximately 200,000 service members transitioning out of the military each year, this upward trend is expected to continue. Adding urgency to this need is the anticipated Federal Reduction in Force, which places approximately 84,000 Veterans currently in government positions at risk of unemployment, many of whom are ineligible for traditional transition assistance. As demand accelerates, expanding ACP’s capacity to connect participants with meaningful, long-term employment opportunities is not only necessary but urgent.\n\nACP has identified that the Pacific Northwest region is an area where many transitioning military want to make their homes post-military, thus, ACP staff has developed and deepened relationships with PNW military installations and funders like the Schultz Family Foundation, the JTMF Foundation and others.", "Funding_Impact": "ACP's greatest challenge is meeting the demand for our services, as ACP has seen exponential growth in the last several years. In 2021, ACP received over 11,000 application requests for mentorships. That number jumped to over 14,000 applications in 2022, and more than 17,000 applications by the end of 2023. With nearly 200,000 service members transitioning out of the military each year, there is an ever-growing need to identify more funding opportunities and recruit Mentors to keep pace with the growing number of veterans and active-duty military spouses seeking assistance. For each $1,000 that ACP is able to raise from foundation, corporate and individual support, another mentorship can be created to provide additional veterans access to mentorship. A $25,000 grant from the William E. Wockner Foundation will enable expansion of ACP's program in the Pacific Northwest (PNW) to include an additional 25-30 veterans or active duty military spouses, and ACP would expect at least 20 of these mentorships to result in meaningful employment outcomes. This funding would enable ACP to pair additional post-9/11 veterans in Washington and Oregon, recruit mentors to meet this need, and build staff capacity to facilitate this additional cohort of mentorships. ACP would expect to nurture ongoing relationships and create new partnerships with veteran service organizations and military installations in the Pacific Northwest region, such as Joint Base Lewis-McChord (JBLM), Naval Base Kitsap and others, as well as work with local VSOs in the area. ACP anticipates that with this funding, at least 20 Protégés in Washington and Oregon will obtain a positive career outcome, such as new, meaningful employment, during the course of their mentorship. \n\nTo put a human face on the impact of ACP, staff regularly collects anecdotes from participants, including this story of Robert, a 28-year old US Army Veteran (E-4) who completed a one-on-one mentorship with ACP in 2023. “When I first started with ACP , I was lost, homeless, living out of the bed of my truck, eating MREs, out of shape, and mentally torn. I wanted to thank…my mentor for completely turning my life around. I’m now working my dream job as a cybersecurity analyst, got employed with Leidos, and I just moved into a beautiful apartment!” Like Robert, 80% of ACP Protégés are enlisted and 37% self disclose as wounded.

Families have been particularly at risk of homelessness as they have been greatly impacted by the effects of the pandemic, learning loss, inflation, rent increases, and diminishing area resources. Families now need more resources to resolve their crisis, resulting in overall longer stays in family shelters across King County.   \n\nHomelessness has long-term adverse effects on families. School disruption and instability while homeless make it harder for children to succeed academically. In the Lake Washington School District, where NBP is located, only 13% of children experiencing homelessness met math standards and only 24% met English standards; compared to the 72% and 80% of housed children that met standards.  \n\nCCA operates New Bethlehem Programs (NBP) to meet the shelter and hygiene needs for the growing number of homeless families in the Eastside cities of King County. Located in Kirkland, NBP stabilizes homeless families through two core components: its day center and 24/7 shelter.  \n\nNBP started in 2015 solely as a day center. The New Bethlehem Day Center has provided a welcoming space to homeless families who have few spaces to turn to for refuge and services during the day. The Day Center provides families with essential services that they are unable to get while they are without a home. The Day Center offers easy access to showers, grab-and-go meals, laundry, and onsite case management that strives to improve their quality of life and return families to stable permanent housing. \n\nAfter the initial success from the day center and in response to growing family homelessness, NBP successfully advocated for overnight shelter services. Partnering with local governments, organizations and churches, New Bethlehem Place opened in 2020, as a 24/7 enhanced shelter providing 10 units families. Previously, families experiencing homelessness were forced to travel back and forth between temporary overnight shelters and our day center because these programs operated in different locations and neither were 24/7. The old model was taxing on families and did not promote stability. Now, at New Bethlehem Place, families have 24/7 space they can call their own, while also receiving around the clock support on their path toward stability. Families enrolled in the shelter program have access to warm meals, a kitchen, laundry facilities, computers, free nurse practitioners, employment support, mental health services, and housing case management.", "Funding_Impact": "Grant funds will directly support program operations and staffing for New Bethlehem Programs’ day center and 24/7 enhanced shelter. NBP serves 196 individuals/68 households through its day center, and 156 individuals/40 families its shelter. In 2024, NBP moved 12 families from homelessness into housing and 3 families into transitional housing.  \n\nNBP recognizes that success looks different for each family. For some, success is getting housed; for others, it could be accessing healthcare or accessing shelter while their children stay in school.  \n\n\n\nBelow is an anecdote of a recent family’s experience at NBP, illustrating the journey families go on when they arrive at our program. \n\nIn 2022, &quot;Jane” and “John” became homeless in Auburn with two daughters aged 13 and 17. The family struggled to maintain housing after John lost his job due to a combination of substance usage and inability to complete job tasks. After five months living in their car with their dog, the family was welcomed into New Bethlehem Program's hotel shelter. The path towards rehousing was not linear for the family. \n\nUpon arriving at the shelter, the family worked with their case manager to successfully enroll into a governmental program that enabled the children to remain at their current out-of-district school. This was an important family priority as the 17-year-old was completing her senior year, and the 13-year-old is a non-verbal autistic youth with an Individual Education Plan needing extensive care. Being uprooted would have been extremely detrimental to both daughters’ education experience and outcomes.  \n\nAfter stabilizing their life through consistent shelter, the family began looking for permanent housing and found an affordable housing unit. As they were about to move in, they were notified at the last moment that they were no longer income eligible. Their total household income was a few hundred dollars over the income eligibility; largely due to their daughter recently obtaining part-time employment after graduating high school. This devastating setback led the family to extend their stay in shelter for another year.  \n\nIn May 2025, NBP was finally able to assist the family move into an apartment unit in Renton. The eldest daughter was able to maintain her employment, and the younger daughter was able to remain in the school district that met her needs. Transportation was eased as they are near a major bus line and in close proximity to the services needed to support the medical/autism diagnosis and treatment plan.", "Org_Budget": 44700268.0, "Org_Budget_Upload": "https://wewocknerfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/ninja-forms/4/FY-24-25-CCA-Budget.pdf", "Project Budget": 1481002.0, "Project_Budget": "https://wewocknerfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/ninja-forms/4/NBP-Budget-FY26-1.xlsx", "Proj_Budget_Upload": "New Bethlehem Programs and CCA have been grateful for private foundation support, such as from the William E Wockner Foundation, which help to fill funding shortfalls to be able to continue providing essential services. Your foundation’s support in 2021 and 2024 enabled NBP to respond to the needs of homeless families in the midst of a pandemic, growing number of homeless families, and overall longer stays in shelters across King County. \n\nSupport the foundation is able to provide in 2025 will be equally as vital as it was during the pandemic. Both NBP and CCA are currently facing budgetary deficits causing significant reductions in program services. These deficits are largely due to recent widespread public funding reductions in human services, early childhood education, and senior services across local city and county governments.  \n\nThe loss of funding from Eastside cities has directly led NBP needing to close its 24/7 hotel shelter at the end of 2025. In 2020, NBP coordinated with a local hotel to add extra shelter units and give families additional space to socially distance during the pandemic. Post-pandemic, NBP continued to operate the hotel space as the need for shelter only increased. For the last five years, NBP’s Hotel Shelter has helped numerous families on the Eastside, providing 10 units of shelter and annually shelters around 80 individuals. In fact, Jane, John, and their two daughters (mentioned above) were provided shelter through the NBP Hotel Shelter. Closing the hotel shelter means that in 2026, NBP’s capacity to shelter families will be cut in half. \n\nThough the hotel space will be closing, Wockner Foundation support will still have tremendous impact to ensure that the Day Center and 24/7 enhance shelter can remain operational and that further services will not need to be reduced in 2026. NBP receives extensive community support from local organizations, individuals, and churches who donate their time, finances, and resources to supporting New Bethlehem families. Through this community support, NBP anticipates raising over $300,000 through individual/foundation contributions which is comparable to what was raised for the 2025 fiscal year. NBP is seeking $49,000 in additional funding sources to help close its funding gap. $15,000 in grant support from the Wockner Foundation would provide significant impact towards closing in on NBP fundraising goal and maintain operations.", "Recognition": "If awarded, CCA and NBP are open to exploring ways to promote the partnership and contribution from the William E Wockner Foundation.

As her usual exercise routines were disrupted, she began to lose mobility and struggled with basic activities like gardening. When she heard about ACRS’ virtual Enhanced Fitness classes through Club Bamboo, she joined “Cloud Bamboo,” the virtual version of our senior center created to help older adults stay active and connected from home. With a tablet and digital training provided by ACRS, she was soon exercising, meditating, and singing karaoke with over 60 other elders over Zoom. The program helped her regain mobility and eased the anxiety brought on by isolation. \n\nFrom there, Yuriko was connected to other ACRS services. She began attending Club Bamboo’s lunch program, where she received hot, culturally familiar meals. She also received support from our citizenship services, and with help from ACRS staff, she achieved her dream of becoming a U.S. citizen. \n\nHer story reflects the power of ACRS’ holistic approach, where one connection leads to many supports across our continuum of care. From meals and technology access to wellness classes and legal support, our services help older adults like Yuriko live with dignity, purpose, and community.\n\nAt the same time, we are deeply concerned about the impact of federal budget changes, including cuts to Medicaid and SNAP, which could leave many of our AA&NH/PI elders without access to health care or food. These clients already face language and cultural barriers, and losing vital benefits would only deepen isolation, food insecurity, and poor health outcomes. \n\nSupport from the William Wockner Foundation ensures we can continue providing culturally responsive care, meals, and case management—even as public funding becomes more uncertain.

Wockner Foundation to support our Low-Income Repair Program, which ensures safe, reliable transportation for individuals experiencing or at risk of homelessness. In 2024, 30–40% of our clients were living in their vehicles, a number that continues to grow as housing insecurity rises across Seattle. For these community members, a functioning vehicle is more than transportation—it is shelter, safety, and a lifeline to employment, healthcare, and stability.\n\nAdditionally, Low-income and BIPOC individuals face disproportionate policing and financial penalties for minor vehicle issues like broken headlights or windshields, which often escalate into citations, fines, and missed work due to court dates. These cascading hardships can destabilize already vulnerable individuals. A.R.T.’s Low-Income Repair Program addresses these inequities by covering urgent repairs, offering preventative maintenance, and empowering clients with education and advocacy so they can avoid exploitation in the auto repair system.\n\nThis program welcomes all low-income people in Washington and prioritizes BIPOC, women, 2SLGBTQIA+, and unhoused residents referred by our network of community partners. Each repair prevents unnecessary traffic stops, protects clients from predatory practices, and reduces barriers to economic mobility by ensuring reliable transportation to jobs, childcare, and vital services. \n\nProviding low-income community members with free repairs and education about their vehicle is critical to our mission to close the equity gap in the automotive repair industry and ensure that all people—regardless of race, gender, or income—can access safe, reliable transportation. By supporting this program, the Wockner Foundation will help us keep community members housed, working, and safe, while reducing the systemic harms that disproportionately impact those already marginalized. With $20,000 in funding, A.R.T. can provide emergency and preventative repairs to over 30 unhoused or housing-insecure clients, preventing the loss of shelter and income while creating pathways to stability.\n\nA.R.T. doesn’t just fix cars—we help people move forward, safely and with dignity. This program embodies our mission by addressing the intersection of transportation, housing insecurity, and economic justice, ensuring no one is left stranded on the road to opportunity.", "Funding_Impact": "In 2024 A.R.T. provided nearly $35,000 in critical vehicle repairs to low-income community members through our Lights Out on Racism and Low-Income Repair programs. This work included 177 safety inspections, 275 light replacements, and 700 hours of client education to empower participants around preventative maintenance and repair. Among those we served, 30% were living in their vehicles, 15% were survivors of domestic violence, and 37% were caregivers. Of these clients, 86% were women, transgender, or non-binary, 75% were people of color, and 72% earned less than $25,000 annually.\n\nWhile this funding is life-saving, it currently covers only emergency safety repairs—allowing us to get vehicles roadworthy but not to address the preventative maintenance that helps avoid catastrophic, costly breakdowns. As a result, many clients return with major repairs that could have been prevented with basic maintenance, stretching both their resources and ours. With $20,000 in new funding from the William E. Wockner Foundation, we can expand our capacity by covering preventative services such as fluid changes, brake checks, and minor tune-ups—low-cost interventions that keep cars safe, operational, and prevent high-cost emergencies. By reducing the incidence of major repairs, we can serve more individuals for the same cost, keeping more people safely housed, working, and mobile.\n\nBeyond repairs, A.R.T. strengthens economic mobility and equity in the automotive field. In 2024, we held 11 workshops for 80 attendees, piloted and launched our industry-specific DEIAB training and online learning portal, and trained four apprentices as part of our soon-to-be Registered Apprenticeship Program. To date, we have mentored 12 apprentices—all LGBTQ+, seven transgender/nonbinary, seven low-income at entry, and four BIPOC—and provided $154,000 in financial assistance to 135 individuals, while serving over 700 people through Lights Out on Racism and 430 participants through 64 workshops.\n\nFunding this expansion allows us not just to fix cars, but to stabilize lives and prevent crises. Reliable transportation is essential for employment, access to services, and, for many, shelter. Specifically, this grant will provide 20–30 preventative maintenance services, deliver 200 additional client education hours, and reduce costly emergency repairs by 25%, allowing us to serve more low-income and housing-insecure clients within the same budget.

Our Lights Out on Racism initiative reduces discriminatory policing and financial hardship by addressing safety issues that disproportionately affect BIPOC and low-income drivers. Through our Community Workshops and one-on-one education, we equip individuals—particularly women, LGBTQIA+, and BIPOC drivers—with the knowledge to maintain their vehicles affordably and avoid costly breakdowns.\n\nBeyond serving drivers, our Apprenticeship Program and Partners in Equity initiative focus on reforming the automotive industry itself, which remains one of the most male-dominated and exclusionary trades. Women make up less than 2% of the technician workforce, while only 7.1% of technicians are Black and 2.9% are Asian. The 2SLGBTQIA+ population is not formally tracked, but given the close ties between gender and LGBTQ-based discrimination, representation is estimated to be well under 10%. These barriers not only limit opportunities for marginalized workers but also worsen the national technician shortage, which is driving up repair costs and wait times for all motorists. By providing a safe, inclusive training pipeline and partnering with shops committed to equity, A.R.T. is expanding the workforce while tapping into a vast, overlooked talent pool.\nEvery program we run contributes to the same goal: transforming transportation from a source of inequity into a powerful economic equalizer.

It quickly became clear that the need was overwhelming, and that diaper need, in particular, demanded urgent attention. In 2016, Star founded Babies of Homelessness with a mission to deliver essential diapers, wipes, and formula directly to families in crisis.\n\nSince then, Babies of Homelessness has remained steadfast in its commitment to meeting this need head-on. As a growing number of families are unable to access basic necessities, we’ve rapidly scaled to keep pace with rising demand. In 2020, we distributed 120,000 diapers. By 2021, with just two full-time staff, one part-time employee, five contractors, and 25 volunteers, we distributed over 300,000 diapers, a 150% increase, reaching 4,957 children. In 2022, that number rose to 441,465 diapers, more than doubling our reach to 10,036 children. In December 2022, we proudly delivered our one-millionth diaper.

This unmet need ripples through the entire family: it increases parental stress and depression, strains bonding, and directly impacts a parent’s ability to work or attend school. That’s where Babies of Homelessness steps in. By providing a supply of diapers, wipes, and formula, delivered directly to families in crisis, we remove a critical barrier to child health, parental well-being, and long-term family stability. The William Wockner Foundation’s support will directly sustain our core diaper bank program in King and Snohomish County, getting diapers, wipes, and formula to families in crisis who would otherwise go without.\n\nWe serve families with young children in deep poverty who are experiencing housing insecurity in King and Snohomish Counties. This includes families who are unhoused, living in shelters or vehicles, in transitional or low-income housing, or in marginalized and underserved rural areas. Our uniquely flexible delivery model ensures that diapers and other essentials reach the families who need them most, wherever they are. To get diapers in the hands of the hardest to reach families, we operate through three flexible distribution channels:\n\nDirect Service: Families facing homelessness or housing insecurity call our intake line to request diapers, wipes, and formula in their preferred sizes. We deliver directly to them, whether they are in a car, encampment, motel, shelter, or couch surfing, within 72 hours. \n\nPartner Distribution: We deliver bulk supplies monthly to 25 community-based organizations. This streamlined system allows case managers to focus on providing wraparound services without the burden of sourcing and transporting diapers.\n\nMobile Pickup: Once a month, families place orders in advance and pick up supplies at one of four bus-accessible sites in Bellevue, Kent, Auburn, and Everett, an essential option for those with transportation challenges.\n\nIn 2025 alone, we are on track to distribute 1.3 million diapers and serve approximately 23,500 children (not unduplicated) across King and Snohomish Counties.", "Org_Budget": 944227.0, "Org_Budget_Upload": "https://wewocknerfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/ninja-forms/4/Organizational-Budget-2025-Babies-of-Homelessness.xlsx", "Project Budget": null, "Project_Budget": null, "Proj_Budget_Upload": "We are deeply grateful to have been supported by the William Wockner Foundation in recent years.

Clients can also access healthcare, housing support, financial assistance, and case management through our on-site community resource hub. By addressing food insecurity and its root causes in one accessible location, we empower community members to build long-term stability and health.\n\nFor more than 50 years, BFB has been a trusted resource for individuals and families experiencing food insecurity and economic hardship—especially low-income households, communities of color, seniors, individuals with disabilities, and those experiencing homelessness. Originally founded in the late 1970s as part of the Northwest YMCA, BFB became part of the North End Emergency Fund in 1985 and evolved into the Ballard Magnolia Food Bank before adopting the name Ballard Food Bank in 2001. In October 2021, we opened our current 11,000-square-foot facility in Seattle’s Ballard neighborhood. This welcoming space has enabled us to dramatically expand services and better respond to rising community needs.\n\nMonthly household visits to BFB have more than tripled in recent years, from an average of 3,200 pre-pandemic to over 10,500 today. This surge reflects broader challenges: significant cuts to the Federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) in 2023, when every SNAP recipient faced a minimum $100 reduction in their monthly benefits, with even larger cuts for families with children; ongoing uncertainty about future SNAP support; and the soaring cost of living. A recent study shows that 1 in 4 Washington households struggle to afford basic needs.

Hunger creates significant barriers to learning and healthy development, hindering kids’ ability to concentrate in the classroom and thrive physically and emotionally. Adequate nutrition is a fundamental requirement for educational success and a foundation for a healthy future.\n\nWe are requesting support for our Weekend Food for Kids (WFFK) program. Each week, we provide bags of food over the weekend for 650+ students at 21 Seattle Public Schools whose families are experiencing food insecurity. Each bag of food contains two breakfasts, two lunches, three dinners, snacks, and fresh produce, effectively bridging the weekend food gap. During the summer months, we maintain continuity by operating a mobile Weekend Food for Kids market that distributes food bags at local community centers, ensuring consistent access to vital nutrition for children year-round.\n\nThis nutritious food supports kids’ academic performance, overall health, and well-being. Furthermore, we connect participating families to our broader food bank services, creating a holistic support system. To ensure our program remains effective and responsive, we regularly gather feedback from students, teachers, and school administrators, tailoring our offerings to their specific needs and preferences. For example, we ask students and families to share dietary restrictions and cultural food preferences when they sign up for the program, allowing us to better accommodate individual needs. Last school year, approximately 25% of our food bags were customized to reflect these dietary considerations. We also host focus groups with participating students and families to solicit feedback. \n\nAligning with our mission to bring food and hope to our neighbors, WFFK helps fosters healthy learning, physical well-being, and cognitive development by ensuring kids have enough to eat.

The State of Washington asked Bridge to take on these more challenging cases after stating that Bridge is “the gold standard of care for children entering foster care in Washington State.”\n\nWe work to help protect, empower and support children who have not had the kind of trauma intervention they so desperately need - children who are then held accountable later in life when they end up incarcerated, exploited, homeless or in other ways in need of further services that immediate trauma care as children could have helped to mitigate. Our primary areas of focus are protecting children with safety and life-saving trauma care right from the start and, when that care hasn’t been provided, giving them the support, tools and understanding they need to lessen the impact of chronic trauma in their lives.  Foster care is supposed to protect children from harm, but the current system exacerbates that harm.  Bridge Receiving Center is seeking to change that by providing children with the wrap-around support, services and understanding they need to end the harm, help them stop blaming themselves and find their way out of shame and on into healing. We intervene at critical times in their foster care journeys. Bridge meets children’s daily needs and beyond, providing vital trauma responsive care that equips “first-time” and “continuing care” children with the tools and understanding they need to not only survive but thrive in foster care.\n\nTo date, Bridge has served over 300 children between the ages of 2 – 17 from 12 counties across Washington State– primarily King, Snohomish and Skagit Counties, but also Island, San Juan, Pierce, Whatcom, Spokane, Clark, Cowlitz, Lewis and Mason to date as well as working with numerous Native American tribes across the state.", "Request": 25000.0, "SupportType": "General Operating Support", "Project_Name": null, "Project_Description": null, "Funding_Impact": "The impact of trauma-responsive care in a child’s life is the ability to connect with their emotions and bodies, develop resilience, learn important life skills, receive much-needed understanding and a sense of empowerment, develop conflict resolution skills, and benefit from connection to outside resources to utilize during their entire foster care experience. \n\nBridge anticipates serving upwards of 100 children in 2025 by helping to reduce the trauma they are experiencing in foster care – trauma from what happened in their own homes, from being removed from home as well as from failed placements in care. Children in foster care have experienced abuse, neglect, mental health challenges, and disconnection from school and family which can lead to tragic outcomes such as homelessness, dropping out of school, becoming a victim of sex trafficking, substance abuse and incarceration.

Recently, CIFR established a Community Assistance Referral and Education Services (CARES) Program with the help of the Camano Center to further advance this outreach. The Camano branch of Island County Health's Camano annex as well as the Northwest Regional Council, Camano's aging and disability resource specialists, have joined CIFR and the Camano Center to establish a consortium to ensure the success of CARES. \nAs CIFR is not a 501(c)(3), the Camano Center has graciously agreed to act as its fiscal agent for grants requiring a non-profit organization. Considering the extensive partnership and integration the CARES program has established with these entities, this benefits both agencies and further helps to ensure the success of meeting Camano's gap in service needs.", "Request": 522471.0, "SupportType": "Project/Purpose", "Project_Name": "Camano CARES ", "Project_Description": "Camano CARES (Community assistance referral and education services program was established in 2023 by Camano Island Fire and Rescue (CIFR) in support and conjunction with the Camano Center, the two biggest entities contributing to island wellness and support on Camano Island. The program is similar to other established CARES or community paramedic programs in the region with a few marked differences, most notably, its focus on bridging social gaps and empowering Camano's aging population to successfully age in place, identifying and creating resources to support them beyond what is currently provided by the Camano Center and CIFR. CARES was established by a local Camano RN, Leah Palyu, volunteering at CIFR when the previous paramedic program was no longer able to be supported during/post COVID due mainly as a result of healthcare staffing shortages felt nationwide. Leah has worked over the last year to create partnerships with community leaders and any &quot;helpers&quot; identified to give the CARES program its needed structure, foundation and integration to ensure it will be sustainable through the years. Camano Center and the CARES program share the goal of empowering the residents of Camano to age in place well, with full, rich, safe lives. CARES focuses largely on prevention and connection to services made possible by extensive home assessments performed by the CARES team. This visit focuses not only on fall risks and reduction, but also on nutritional needs and social isolation. Education about medication and medical conditions are also given along with help connecting people to any needs identified- establishing healthcare providers or making plans/lists of questions to ask in upcoming appointments, help with yard/housework, cooking, caregiving, companionship, or transportation. As needs are identified, the list of help offered grows thanks to the amazing group of volunteers being identified and trained through the Camano Center and CIFR. \nFuture goals include expanding CARES to include a mobile integrated health vehicle with satellite wifi so residents with limited or no wifi connection, with limited mobility/transportation capabilities, can be given telehealth appointments with the CARES RN and their provider from the comfort of their home. Including full assessments and lab work with the RN acting as the eyes and ears of the MD over the telehealth screen.", "Funding_Impact": "CARES is currently unfunded. Leah has been volunteering her time at CIFR to create this desperately needed program to bridge the substantial gaps in health and social services on Camano Island. While CIFR is in full support and provides her with as much help as possible, it has been difficult to train the team needed to make CARES successful. The Camano Center has also been integral in collaborating with Leah to support and assist her in creating foundational documents and assessment tools that can be used to create consistent, great care provided by all CARES team members. As Leah is still working full time as an RN at Harborview Medical Center, her ability to fully commit to CARES and seeing it expand to its potential has been limited. \nLeah, as CIFR, the Camano Center, and Island County Health have been helping to identify funding opportunities to address this problem. CARES is in talks with the Accountable Communities of Health, federal HRSA grants, Senator Patty Murray's office, Representative Rick Larson's office, Island County Commissioner Janet St. Claire, and a multitude of private entities and local Tribes in hopes of funding CARES. CIFR is also intending to add a CARES budget item, or at least a portion of it, in its upcoming budget as well. \nWhen CARES is funded, Leah will be able to immediately start cross training all fire EMTS and paramedics, and any other volunteers, such as retired RNs to perform the CARES home assessment, within their appropriate scope of practice. Leah will also be able to expand promotion of the program and further identify helpers, such as local churches and community groups. CARES will also be able to function 5+ days a week, increasing its impact from roughly 4-6 households per month to upwards of 40+. We hope to partner with local hospitals, rehabs, and nursing facilities to follow up with discharged residents within 24-48hrs to ensure they understand their paperwork, medications and have all their needs met to prevent bounce back to the hospital system. The impact on our aging, geographically isolated, rural island and its vulnerable population is immeasurable.\nAny fiscal contribution would be greatly appreciated. One that could fully fund the director position would be enough to fully launch this program. The rest will come. It must.

Our organization serves Camano Island, a rural community of 17,000 residents—including over 5,000 seniors—who face serious barriers to care due to geographic isolation and limited local healthcare services.\nThe Center’s origin dates to the early 1970s, when neighbors recognized that seniors were underserved and lacking access to basic services such as nutrition and transportation. In 1973, a grant allowed Senior Services of Island County to bring meal services to Camano, which were delivered to multiple island sites. In 1982, CSSA was incorporated to expand and formalize this growing network of support. From those humble beginnings, we have grown into a thriving hub of community-based services, social connection, and resource navigation.\nMajor milestones include the 2001 opening of our dedicated Senior Center, the 2011 rebranding to “Camano Center” to better reflect our inclusive vision, and the establishment of the 2nd Chance Thrift Shop, which now provides a significant portion of our operating revenue. We receive no direct government funding, and our sustainability depends on a committed network of volunteers, donors, and community partners.\nOur track record of accomplishments is grounded in over four decades of impact, continually adapting to meet the evolving needs of our aging population. In addition to social, educational, and wellness programming, we lead initiatives that address food access, isolation, and safety—like our Camano Helping Hands & Volunteer Chore Program, which connects trained volunteers with older adults who need help to remain in their homes.\nThe Center operates with financial discipline and long-term planning, supported by an endowment fund and major giving program. A transformative gift in 2013 allowed us to pay off our building mortgage, and subsequent capital campaigns have strengthened our infrastructure and thrift operations. Our ability to adapt, engage, and serve—without government oversight or funding—underscores our commitment to local solutions for local challenges.\nAt the heart of our work is a belief in dignity, independence, and community connection. Every service we provide helps older adults on Camano Island live safer, healthier, and more connected lives.", "Request": 29163.0, "SupportType": "Project/Purpose", "Project_Name": "Camano Helping Hands/Volunteer Chore Program", "Project_Description": "The Camano Helping Hands/Volunteer Chore Program supports healthy aging, independence, and well-being by helping older adults and adults with functional disabilities remain safely in their homes. This program directly aligns with the Camano Center’s mission: to support healthy aging, connection, and well-being for adults 55 and older.\nMany Camano Island residents face isolation, limited mobility, and few affordable service options. For seniors who do not qualify for traditional low-income programs—but still cannot afford help—the Helping Hands Program provides a vital safety net. Through volunteer assistance, we help with tasks like light housekeeping, yard maintenance, errands, transportation to medical appointments, home safety modifications, and minor repairs.\nThe process begins with a completed referral from a case manager, medical provider, or resource specialist. Many referrals come through our area agency on aging, Northwest Regional Council, or the Camano CARES program.  Our staff then follows up with the client by phone to clarify the project scope. Each task is then posted to an online volunteer coordination platform (SignUpGenius), which sends weekly email updates to registered volunteers.\nWhen a volunteer accepts a task, they receive any tools or supplies they need from the Camano Center, along with project details. Once the job is complete, both the client and volunteer sign off on the work. Volunteers then submit mileage or other approved expenses for reimbursement.\nAll new volunteers must complete an application, pass a background check, and attend training before they begin service.\nThe Camano Center also partners with the Opportunity Council’s Volunteer Chore Program, which supports very low-income seniors (below $2,366/month for a single-person household). Our Helping Hands Program complements this by serving those who fall just above that threshold but still lack support or cannot afford help. Services are provided based on volunteer availability, and no services are guaranteed.\nIt costs about $400 per year to support one client through this program—far less than the estimated $54,000 annual cost of assisted living. By offering personalized support at home, we reduce emergency calls, prevent early institutionalization, and build meaningful community connections.\nThe Helping Hands Program reflects our commitment to community-driven solutions that improve quality of life for older adults. With a growing volunteer base and structured procedures in place, we are well-positioned to expand this essential program and further our mission across Camano Island.", "Funding_Impact": "These funds will directly support the Camano Helping Hands / Volunteer Chore Program, which serves low-income seniors and adults with functional disabilities who are striving to remain safely and independently in their homes. Camano Island is a rural community with limited access to transportation, paid services, and family support—making this program a lifeline for many vulnerable residents.\nOur program matches trained volunteers with individuals who need help with everyday tasks such as yard care, grocery shopping, prescription pickup, dog walking, and light housekeeping. These are simple but critical services that help prevent falls, address social isolation, support mental health, and reduce the need for premature institutional care.\nWe estimate that this funding will allow us to serve at least 75 individuals over the next 12 months, while also building volunteer capacity and improving service coordination. Every person served will receive personalized assistance based on need and volunteer availability. Importantly, all services are provided free of charge—removing barriers for clients who are low-income or unable to afford help on their own.\nThe need is significant in our rural community, and our client list continues to grow. With your support, we will be able to expand outreach, recruit and retain volunteers, manage referrals efficiently, and provide a safety net for those who have nowhere else to turn. Many of our clients are aging alone, without nearby family or support systems, and would otherwise go without essential help.\nThis funding will not only support direct services, but also ensure long-term sustainability through volunteer training, staff coordination, and outreach to potential referral partners. Each act of help - blackberries cleared, groceries delivered, a home tidied, a path to a bathroom cleared for safety—may seem small, but it makes a big difference in someone’s life.\nYour investment in this program will bring Bill Wockner’s vision to life: helping those who need it most and honoring the strength, dignity, and value of every individual in our community.", "Org_Budget": 911529.0, "Org_Budget_Upload": "https://wewocknerfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/ninja-forms/4/2024-2025-Budget-CC-.xlsx", "Project Budget": 29163.0, "Project_Budget": "https://wewocknerfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/ninja-forms/4/Camano-Helping-Hands-Budget.xlsx", "Proj_Budget_Upload": "The Camano Helping Hands/Volunteer Chore Program grew naturally out of the Camano Community Assistance Referral and Education Services (CARES) project, a collaborative initiative launched in 2023 by Camano Fire and Rescue (CIFR) and community partners—including the Camano Center—to address significant healthcare and social service gaps for Camano Island’s aging population. With limited local healthcare access and a high number of older adults, the island faces rising rates of isolation, chronic conditions, and non-emergent 911 calls. The CARES Project aims to reduce emergency service strain by providing proactive, community-based support that helps seniors remain safely in their homes.\nAs a key partner, the Camano Center—a 501(c)(3) nonprofit operating without government funding—plays a central role in connecting residents with non-medical services that support independence and aging in place. One of the most urgent needs identified by the CARES team has been help with basic household tasks and transportation—essential, everyday needs that, when unmet, can lead to injury or loss of independence.\nTo meet this need, the Camano Center launched the Camano Helping Hands Program, which matches trained volunteers with clients needing assistance with minor home repairs, yard work, fall-prevention home organization, medical transportation, and other vital errands. The Center soon partnered with the Opportunity Council’s Volunteer Chore Program, which provides similar services to individuals below a strict income cap ($2,366/month for one person; $2,704 for two). The Camano Center now fills the gap by serving those slightly above these thresholds who still cannot afford help or have no available support network.\nReferrals for assistance must come from a case manager, healthcare professional, or trained resource specialist.\nGrant funding will support Camano Center staff members Angie Bayley and Karen Conway in administering and growing the program. Angie, as Resource Specialist, oversees volunteer recruitment, coordination, and client matching. Karen, as Outreach Director, builds partnerships, connects clients with services, and leads community awareness efforts. Both staff members also provide volunteer support for participants in both Helping Hands and the Volunteer Chore Program.\nAdditionally, the Camano Center enhances care through wraparound services such as a medical equipment lending closet, Meals on Wheels referrals, caregiver support groups, the Camano Friends Club (dementia respite), Aging Mastery Program, foot care, and more.\nCamano Helping Hands is a grassroots, community-based solution that’s already improving quality of life and access to support services—advancing the shared mission of CIFR and the Camano Center to keep older adults safe, connected, and thriving.", "Recognition": "To express our sincere gratitude and ensure meaningful recognition of the William E.

CCYJ was selected to manage a $12 million grant by the MacArthur Foundation to lead its juvenile justice reform initiative, Models for Change, in Washington. \n\nEach year in Washington, thousands of children and youth are involved in the child welfare and youth justice systems. Youth involved in these systems often experience significant unaddressed trauma, neglect, and abuse that lead to increased risks for these young people--including sex trafficking, poverty, homelessness, and recurrent incarceration as children and adults.

At the start, we were a tiny organization, one part-time staff member coordinating a handful of volunteer attorneys. But even then, the goal was big: make sure poverty never stood in the way of access to justice.\n\nUnder the 10-year leadership of current Executive Director, we’ve grown into a trusted legal aid provider serving low-income residents of Chelan and Douglas Counties in Central Washington. Our team now includes five full-time staff, three contracted attorneys, more than 50 volunteer attorneys, and several volunteer interpreters. In 2024, we welcomed our first AmeriCorps members to expand outreach and client support. We offer weekly bilingual walk-in legal clinics and up to six additional legal consults each week. In these consultations, attorneys share an afternoon or morning to help several people move their cases forward. Civil legal issues vary from housing, family law, employment law, reentry, debt relief, will and POA drafting, and so much more.\n\nSince the William E. Wockner Foundation’s first grant in 2020, we’ve grown from serving 270 people to nearly 800 annually! That growth reflects intentional investments in people, systems, and space.\n\nIn 2023, outgrowing our 1,000 square foot office, we had an incredible opportunity to purchase a former medical clinic and turn it into the region’s first permanent home for civil legal aid. With incredible community and foundation support, renovations are nearly finished, and we moved in this month! The 5,000 square foot building—centrally located, ADA accessible, and welcoming—reflects our belief that legal help should be visible, approachable, and built to last. It is more than an office. It is a hub for stability, a space where clients, attorneys, volunteers, and partners can come together to uplift the mission of access to justice!\n\nWe believe legal aid strengthens families, keeps people housed, supports those living with illness or disability, and opens doors for people trying to move forward. Our work aligns with the Foundation’s priorities—Family Shelter and Support, Needs of Youth, Seniors and Vulnerable Adults, and Medical Care.

The Program connects more children and families to our Child Advocacy Center for the services they need to recover from child abuse. The Additional Information section of this proposal (below) elaborates on the services that families will receive because of the Program.\n\nABOUT DAWSON PLACE\nDawson Place is a single location in Everett, Washington, occupied by six organizations providing the services needed by child abuse victims and families.\n\nMission: Dawson Place is a group of professionals responding to concerns of child abuse. We are dedicated to helping kids, seeking justice, and promoting healthy families.\n\nHistory: Dawson Place was founded in 2006, gained National Children’s Alliance accreditation in 2007, and earned 501(c)(3) status in 2009. We average 1,077 children served annually: 4-5 new kids per day, Monday - Friday. Over 19,000 families have received services at our Center.\n\nWhy: Because EVERY child abuse survivor deserves safety, justice, and healing.\n\nWho: Dawson Place serves child and youth victims (age 0-18) of sexual assault, physical abuse, neglect, drug endangerment and witness to violent crime. Therapy is provided through age 22.\n\nWhat: Dawson Place and five co-located agencies provide, free of charge, every service needed by child abuse victims and their non-offending family members: medical healthcare, mental health therapy, victim/legal advocacy, protective services, criminal investigations and prosecutions.\n\nWhere: Snohomish County, WA\n\nHow: Dawson Place coordinates interagency services and operates the facility that supports 70+ service providers from six co-located agencies helping child abuse victims and families.\nChild-Centered: At Dawson Place children feel safe, listened to, cared about, and comforted. Our service providers communicate at the child or youth’s level with compassion and competence. Our child-centered approach makes kids want to return for the help they need to recover.\n\nCommunity Programs: Our Community Outreach Program engages with communities across our service area so that more people know how to access our services. Our Parenting Education Program offers free parenting classes that prevent child maltreatment and empower parents with the knowledge, support, and confidence to raise healthy, thriving children.", "Request": 20000.0, "SupportType": "Project/Purpose", "Project_Name": "Community Outreach Program - Serve More Child Abuse Victims", "Project_Description": "COMMUNITY NEED – CHILD ADVOCACY CENTER SERVICES\n\n1 in 10 children will be sexually abused before they turn 18: that is 18,416 kids in Snohomish County (US Census, July 2023). Another 5,249 will need our services for physical abuse, neglect, drug endangerment, or witness to a violent crime – 23,665 youth over the next 18 years (1,315/year). Untreated child abuse victims often suffer from low self-esteem, PTSD, anxiety, and depression. These side effects can lead to trouble at school, teen pregnancy, drug/alcohol abuse, and other risky behaviors. These behaviors increase their odds of poverty, homelessness, sex trafficking, and chronic disease, and inhibit child abuse victims from reaching their full potential.\n\nUnfortunately, the demand for Dawson Place’s free services is high, averaging 1,077 children and youth per year over the last 5 years. The following 5 years of data relate to our fiscal year ending June 30. \n•\t2020: 1,077 clients\n•\t2021: 1,095 clients\n•\t2022: 1,100 clients\n•\t2023: 1,071 clients\n•\t2024: 1,047 clients\n•\t5-Year Total: 5,387 clients\n•\t5-Year Annual Average: 1,077 clients\n\nCOMMUNITY NEED – OUTREACH\nDawson Place performs an annual Service Gap Analysis to assess the difference between the number of children served and the statistical demand for services. The most recent analysis for the fiscal year ending June 2024 pulls population data from the US Census (July 1, 2023). We apply child abuse statistics provided by our accreditor, the National Children’s Alliance, to the US Census population data to calculate the statistical service demand. The numbers show: \n\n•\t23,655 children and youth will need Dawson Place over the next 18 years.\n•\t1,315 children and youth will need Dawson Place this year.\n•\t1,077 children and youth are served annually at Dawson Place (5-year average).\n•\tA service gap of 238 children and youth exists between the number of kids served and the statistical demand for services.\n•\tGap Total: 22%\n\nA William E Wockner Foundation grant would be invested in our efforts to close the service gap.", "Funding_Impact": "The Community Outreach Program: \n•\tSpreads awareness about our free services\n•\tGrows the network that refers victims to Dawson Place\n•\tEmpowers child abuse survivors to get the help they need to stop abuse and live safe, healthy lives.\n\nService gap analysis using US Census data and verified child abuse statistics reveals a 22% gap between the annual average served at Dawson Place (1,077/year) and the statistical demand (1,315/year). That is 238 children who need but do not receive our services.\n\nThe goal is a 2% increase in clients served annually until the 22% service gap is reduced to zero. A 2% increase over 1,077 clients served annually would be 22 more child abuse victims next year.

Seventy percent of TCC families are BIPOC, and 40% are low-income. Roughly 25% of the children we serve have diagnosed disabilities or complex needs. Many have been expelled from other programs or denied enrollment due to behavioral or developmental challenges.\n\nBy improving the safety and functionality of our classrooms, and by installing solar panels to reduce operating costs, this project will help TCC provide long-term, affordable access to high-quality early learning in an  inclusive environment. Cost savings from solar energy will allow us to expand tuition assistance programs and help ensure that no child is turned away due to financial hardship.\n\nRenovations will also improve supervision and accessibility, including better classroom visibility, safe bathroom configurations, and inclusive play space.

We connect people, landscapes, and wildlife across boundaries through collaborative efforts that restore and protect ecological connectivity – the unimpeded movement of species and the flow of natural processes that sustain life on Earth.\n\nCLLC has emerged as a global leader in connectivity conservation, supporting over 1,200 large-scale landscape and seascape initiatives worldwide. We provide scientific tools, policy expertise, strategy guidance, and technical support to help partners, from local communities to national governments, and implement durable conservation strategies across terrestrial, freshwater, and marine systems. Our work spans local to international scales and integrates science with practice to help partners, from government agencies to grassroots networks, achieve durable conservation outcomes.\n\nIn the U.S., CLLC has a long-standing focus on the American West. Our “West-Wide Study to Identify Important Highway Locations for Wildlife Crossings,” completed in partnership with federal and state agencies, identified key locations where infrastructure can be improved to reduce wildlife-vehicle collisions and restore habitat connectivity across the region. We have also supported state and tribal agencies, NGOs, and communities with corridor assessments, policy development, and funding strategies to advance on-the-ground conservation. \n\nWe also bring deep expertise in using long-distance trails as organizing frameworks for connectivity conservation. Since 2017, CLLC has played a central role in the Appalachian Trail Landscape Partnership (ATLP), beginning with a climate corridor analysis and expanding into stakeholder engagement and regional conservation planning across 15 states. The ATLP has become a national model for collaborative, climate-smart landscape conservation.\n\nIn 2024, the Pacific Crest Trail Partnership invited CLLC to catalyze a similar movement along the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT). Stretching from Mexico to Canada through nine ecoregions, the PCT traverses a biologically rich yet fragmented landscape. Its national visibility and popularity make it a powerful focal point for landscape conservation in the West. Building on our success with the ATLP, CLLC will lead efforts to convene partners, conduct connectivity analyses, and co-develop a shared strategy to safeguard the ecological integrity of lands surrounding the trails.\n\nFrom the Appalachians to the Pacific, CLLC leads efforts to conserve the interconnected landscapes that wildlife and people depend on by advancing practical, collaborative solutions for large-scale conservation in the face of accelerating change.", "Request": 15000.0, "SupportType": "Project/Purpose", "Project_Name": "Pacific Crest Trail Landscape Partnership Development", "Project_Description": "Climate change is reshaping the American Landscape. Wildfires burn longer and hotter, snowpacks are shrinking, floods are intensifying, and wildlife are shifting their ranges in search of suitable habitat, often into developed areas. In the face of this accelerating disruption, we need large-scale, forward-thinking solutions that connect people to place and ensure nature can adapt and thrive. \n\nCLLC is advancing a bold vision that meets this moment: protecting and restoring ecological connectivity at a continental scale by anchoring efforts around iconic, beloved long-distance trails.  These highly visible and beloved corridors provide an opportunity to catalyze landscape-scale conservation efforts while fostering public awareness and engagement \n\nScience has long shown that the size and connectedness of natural areas are directly linked to biodiversity and species survival. However, the scale of conservation required to meet the challenges of climate change can feel daunting. Long-distance trails offer a tangible, accessible framework for achieving ambitious conservation outcomes while uniting diverse stakeholders around a shared vision.  \n\nOver the past decade, the Appalachian Trail Landscape Partnership, co-led by CLLC and including federal agencies, states, and private citizens, has demonstrated the success of this approach. It has mobilized support across political, jurisdictional, and community boundaries to protect a functional, connected landscape along the trail corridor, where millions of people experience nature each year. This work has inspired a broad and growing coalition committed to long-term, landscape-scale action.  \n\nWe now have the opportunity to bring that successful model westward.  \n\nThe Pacific Crest Trail (PCT), spanning nine ecoregions from Mexico to Canada, weaves through landscapes of immense ecological value, which are increasingly fragmented by roads, agriculture, and development. Despite protections along portions of the trail, large areas remain vulnerable. With more than a million visitors annually, the PCT is a powerful platform for elevating public understanding and support for conservation.  \n\nIn partnership with the Pacific Coast Trail Association, CLLC will help launch a west-wide initiative to conserve the PCT as a climate-resilient corridor. With your support, we will lead the first phase of this effort to conduct landscape analyses, identify priority linkage areas, engage diverse partners, and build a shared conservation strategy to guide durable action.  \nTogether, we can ensure the PCT remains not only a world-class hiking experience, but a thriving corridor for wildlife, ecosystems, and communities for generations to come.

A small group of concerned citizens decided to address this problem. With grant funds, they opened a modest two-room Healthcare for the Homeless clinic in downtown Spokane, providing essential care to uninsured and under resourced individuals.\n\nFor more than three decades, CHAS Health has grown to be one of the most trusted healthcare providers in the region and the area’s largest safety-net primary care provider. Our mission is to improve the overall health of the communities we serve by expanding access to quality health and wellness services. \n\nGEOGRAPHIC REACH AND POPULATION SERVED \nCHAS Health serves diverse urban and rural communities on both sides of the Washington-Idaho border, stretching from the Canadian border 200 miles south to the Lewis-Clark Valley. This expansive service area allows us to reach vulnerable populations wherever they are located.\n\nIn 2024, we served 122,517 unduplicated patients, including 29,880 individuals experiencing homelessness. More than half of our patients are insured through Medicaid, 11% receive Medicare services, 11% are uninsured, 26% have private insurance, and 80% have low incomes. \n\nOur target population includes limited income individuals and families who experience barriers to accessing primary care, such as cost, transportation, homelessness, and insurance gaps. To comprehensively serve these populations, we provide integrated primary medical, pediatrics, dental, behavioral health, pharmacy, gynecological and obstetrical care, as well as nutrition, health education, homeless outreach, and enabling services. These services are available to everyone, regardless of a patient’s insurance status or ability to pay. \n\nRECENT ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND EXPANSION PROJECTS\nCHAS Health’s recent expansion initiatives demonstrate our commitment to meeting evolving community needs. We successfully opened 4 new school-based health center sites, renovated existing space to create larger homes for Spokane Pediatrics and our Lewiston Community Behavioral Health Center, and launched three new mobile medical units with a fourth mobile dental unit coming online in November.

By comparison, Spokane County’s population data show 14% of the population are BIPOC; 6% are Hispanic/Latino; 8.5% speak a primary language other than English; 23% are low income, and 1% are unhoused.\n\nPROJECTED PATIENT IMPACT \nAnother significant impact of this project will be the number of young people served by the expansion. The following patient projections are based on CHAS Health pediatric patients served at our other clinics within Spokane city limits. Projections are also based on our clinics of similar size compared to the fully expanded Spokane Pediatrics clinic. \n\nProjected unduplicated pediatric patients to be served:\nYear One:\n•\t909 pediatric patients receiving behavioral health support\n•\t2,087 children accessing dental care\n•\t9,342 young patients accessing medical care\n\nYear Two:\n•\t1,022 pediatric behavioral health patients accessing care\n•\t3,155 children accessing dental care \n•\t10,497 medical pediatric patients receiving care\n\nCOMPREHENSIVE SERVICES\nPatients will be served through a wraparound, integrated care model. CHAS Health medical, dental, and behavioral health care teams will:\n•\tEnable early detection of dental issues and behavioral health conditions during routine pediatric visits\n•\tCoordinate care between medical, dental, and behavioral health providers to ensure comprehensive treatment planning\n•\tProvide on-site counseling, therapy, and psychiatric services to support children's emotional well-being and development\n•\tOffer parent and child education programs on oral and behavioral health\n•\tReduce disparities in oral and mental health outcomes for low-income children", "Org_Budget": 316058771.0, "Org_Budget_Upload": "https://wewocknerfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/ninja-forms/4/CHAS-Health-FY-2025-Operating-Budget.pdf", "Project Budget": 5865804.0, "Project_Budget": "https://wewocknerfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/ninja-forms/4/CHAS-Health-Spokane-Pediatrics-Expansion-Budget.pdf", "Proj_Budget_Upload": "COMMUNITY NEED AND PROJECT TIMELINE\nCHAS Health’s expanded Spokane Pediatrics Clinic will serve a vital role in addressing healthcare inequities within Spokane's urban core. Located in an underserved neighborhood, the clinic will provide essential medical, dental, and behavioral health services to young people whose families face the greatest barriers to care. \n\nDENTAL HEALTH NEEDS\nThe dental health disparities among Spokane's underserved children are significant. Two-thirds of low-income children suffer from tooth decay, yet access to preventive and treatment services remains critically limited. Washington Health Care Authority data reveals a shocking service gap: despite Medicaid coverage, only 14% of eligible children ages 5 and younger in our service area access dental benefits, with utilization dropping to 12% for children ages 6 to 20. This represents thousands of children and youth who experience preventable pain, infection, and long-term oral health complications that impact their overall health and quality of life.\n\nBEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICE DESERT \nThe mental health landscape presents an equally urgent need. A recent Spokesman Review article documented that approximately 20,000 children and teens in Spokane County experience mental health disorders annually, yet fewer than 15 psychiatrists—potentially as few as 10—specialize in adolescent care. This represents a dramatic shortfall compared to the 50 specialists recommended by the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry. Dr. Erik Loraas, a child psychiatrist with Providence Health, noted that only about 10 child and adolescent psychiatrists serve all of Eastern Washington. The recent closure of Providence Sacred Heart Medical Center's Psychiatric Center for Children and Adolescents has further distressed an already overwhelmed system, leaving families without critical emergency mental health resources.\n\nEducational data reinforces the growing unmet demand. Spokane Public Schools experienced a 42% increase in students requiring psychoeducational evaluations between 2019-2020 and 2022-2023. Students with diagnosed disabilities increased 10% between 2021-2024, surpassing the state's 8% growth rate. Schools struggle to provide adequate behavioral health support, leaving students and families with limited alternatives and highlighting the critical need for the comprehensive behavioral health services CHAS Health’s integrated model will deliver.\n\nEXPANSION TIMELINE\nStage 2 of the CHAS Health Spokane Pediatrics Expansion Project includes the following completion dates for each phase of the project:\n•\tPredesign and design: January 2026 \n•\tDemolition and site preparation: February 2026\n•\tConstruction/renovation: July 2026\n•\tEquipment installation: July 2026\n\nThe expanded clinic expects to begin serving patients with dental and behavioral health services by August 1, 2026.", "Recognition": "If a grant is awarded, CHAS Health will acknowledge the Wockner Foundation’s contribution via social media.

Our ultimate goal: All families in Casino Road reach their full potential. \n\nBorn in 2017 from deep collaboration and a community-run initiative, Connect Casino Road is a community hub that centers the community’s voice as we collaborate with partners and bring workshops to address the needs of families today while we create community building and community-driven advocacy to address the causes of injustice and poverty for tomorrow. \n\nCCR acts as a bridge between Casino Road neighbors and more than 25 complementary partners, enabling them to offer their services free of charge to residents without creating redundancy in services. Residents can access dozens of onsite within walking distance from home: but hosting services is not enough. We run community engagement, connection, and leadership opportunities, convene advocacy efforts, and have a multilingual community resource navigation program in a low-barrier approach to directly connect residents to all programs while only having to tell their often-traumatic stories once.

Nearly 1/3 of residents have immigrated to the US, and nearly 40% of residents face language barriers (U.S. Census Bureau, 2022). More than 90% of those who use our services are low-income immigrant families.\n\nWhat is the result of underinvestment and ingrained barriers that disproportionally affect Casino Road residents?

They used resource navigation to join social support groups onsite and made strong community connections, which Patricia claimed empowered her to return to school. Now, she will complete her associate’s degree and begin her bachelor’s program in fall 2025, aiming to work in social services.

Parents express relief that their children’s safety is no longer an unknown: the most stressful concern for families when facing immigration raids. \n\nWe have had great success coordinating multi-partner immigration clinics with Snohomish County Legal Services and the Latino Bar Association of Washington. During clinics, there is a palpable urgency where there was not before. I have seen the reception area full on clinic days: parents with tears in their eyes and children on their laps.\n\nThese are the kinds of families in dire need of services more than ever before, and we are uniquely positioned to deliver. To maintain safety and trust, we no longer promote these events on social media, which have begun to draw the attention of bad actors. We must instead leverage our powerful word-of-mouth network built over years of our work growing community connections and trust. Thanks to this network, we can still safely fill attendance at immigration and family-related workshops and clinics. \n\nDespite these additional challenges this community is incredibly engaged, even in the face of the unknown.

In 1986, devoted teachers partnered with Marybeth and opened their homes to teach mostly academic subjects. Bill Nye, later known as “The Science Guy,” was one of those early teachers. Classes quickly turned towards more creative pursuits and skills not often taught to youth. Coyote opened its first permanent home in the Central District of Seattle in 2012, doubling the number of youth served within the first five years and growing to serve over 1,000 students a year. \n\nCoyote Central’s mission is to spark creativity in young people by putting tools in their hands to build skills and forge their futures. We accomplish our mission through hands-on, creative learning programs with emergent and professional Artists, cultural workers, and trade specialists who create in wood and metal, digital illustration, painting, sewing and fashion design, robotics, cooking and baking, poetry, screenplay writing, and acting, in addition to youth leadership and advisory programming and public art projects. \n\nCoyote Central programming in 2025: \n● Studio Coyote: Hands-on creative and technology courses for youth 10-15 years old \n● Studio Coyote for Schools: Studio Coyote experiences for groups of youth from public schools, private schools, and community groups\n● Youth Advisory Board: School-year program where youth 15+ facilitate community projects, provide feedback to Coyote staff, volunteer at special events, help interview staff for Coyote Central positions, and other leadership and advisory opportunities\n● CRE8 Futures: Focuses on the early development of workforce skills for youth as they explore different career pathways in the arts and culture sector.\n\nCoyote Central is deeply committed to supporting youth most impacted by structural racism by providing equitable access to arts education. On average, 64% of Studio Coyote participants each year are BIPOC youth. Research indicates that youth in this demographic group are less likely to have access to arts education, contributing to broader achievement gaps. Coyote Central designs its programs and scholarships to dismantle the barriers imposed by structural racism by providing the tools, opportunities, and support necessary for youth to explore their creative potential and forge their futures.

The town has only one grocery store and the next-closest store or food bank requires a 60-mile round trip by car. As a result, access to affordable food is a significant and persistent challenge, especially for individuals with mobility, health, or transportation barriers. In this isolated setting, the food bank is much more than a place to pick up groceries—it is a trusted and dependable source of comfort, connection, and care.\n\nIn 2024, Darrington Food Bank volunteers spent 6,199 hours distributing 457,123 pounds of food, supporting over 17,000 client visits– a 40% increase from 2023.

Funding will allow us to sustain and expand this program. As one supporter put it: “DFB’s model is something that is absolutely magic to prevent homelessness and addiction. Teaching children they are empowered by service—that is such a good strategy to address multiple social issues.”\n\nImprove Infrastructure & Safety: As visits rise and donations fluctuate, we must operate with more efficiency. The food bank’s six freezers are outdated and unreliable, often requiring hours of manual defrosting, causing inefficiency and forcing volunteers to turn away donations. We also need safety upgrades like new stairs to protect volunteers during food loading and distribution. These infrastructure improvements will reduce waste, increase capacity, and ensure a safer working environment for the 25 volunteers and interns who make our mission possible– working 521 hours per month on average.\n\nMeet Growing Needs: Visits to the food bank increased 40% last year and needs are continuing to grow. In our 2025 Feedback Survey, only 61% of clients said they are satisfied with the amount of food they receive. Clients want more distribution times and more choice in what they bring home. With additional funds, we can purchase a greater variety of high-demand items and increase our ability to offer client-centered, choice-based products.\n\nIn the words of one client: “The food bank is a lifeline. It provides the community with both food and support that they need really badly, as well as social connection and treating them as you would your family.” With support from the Wockner Foundation, we can keep growing in the right way—aligned with the needs, hopes, and values of our community.", "Org_Budget": 156687.0, "Org_Budget_Upload": "https://wewocknerfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/ninja-forms/4/Darrington-Food-Bank-2025-Operating-Budget.pdf", "Project Budget": null, "Project_Budget": null, "Proj_Budget_Upload": "Darrington Food Bank aligns closely with three of the Wockner Foundation’s categories of focus.\n\nFamily Shelter and Support: DFB provides reliable access to nutritious food for families (198 households) across rural Snohomish County. Our weekly distributions are a critical resource for those facing financial instability, job loss, or unexpected hardship. Beyond food access, Darrington Food Bank supports families in many other important ways. Clients say DFB has helped them:\nSave money to cover unforeseen expenses (39%);\nStay on top of other bills and expenses (37%);\nFeel reminded that others care about them (37%);\nKnow more about other community resources that can help them (26%); and\nFeel more in control of their life (35%).\n\nAs one parent said: “Darrington Food Bank has been a blessing to my family since the moment I moved here. I can't thank them enough and look forward to volunteering for them to give back one day in the future.” Another client shared: “While we don’t always need to use the food bank, just knowing it is an option is a huge relief and can often allow us to save/invest in other things that are needed.” \n\nThe Needs of Youth: Through our Teen Tent program, we discretely deliver food and hygiene items directly to 53 students at Darrington High School. A local administrator says: “Teen Tent is essential – not only because it meets needs for students but it also allows them to meet their own needs, which is powerful. It gives them a sense of autonomy and self-efficacy which is so important. I see a lot of mental health being addressed through Teen Tent.” Secondly, our Youth Internship program offers paid job training and mentorship to low-income youth, helping build confidence, job-readiness skills, and an appreciation of service. As one supporter recently shared: “Darrington Food Bank is amazing for allowing young teens to help by volunteering. It is not easy to train teenagers. There is a healthy balance of training and guiding and also there has to be standards– there is something about the environment that makes them feel comfortable and able to support their community.”\n\nThe Needs of Seniors and Vulnerable Adults: Our drive-through distribution model allows seniors and those with limited mobility to receive food easily and with dignity. Volunteers maintain close relationships with all food bank clients, providing meal deliveries as needed and offering a regular, trusted source of connection for isolated seniors.", "Recognition": "Darrington Food Bank will recognize the William E.

In fact, they are the only great ape on the planet besides ourselves that is increasing.\n\nHowever, with only 1,000 mountain gorillas remaining, this success is fragile and they remain a heavily conservation-dependent species. Their close cousins, the Grauer’s gorilla, are considered the most vulnerable of all the great apes. Their habitat lies in the middle of a 25-year conflict zone, resulting in a 60% decline in the Grauer’s gorilla population in just the last few decades.\n\nThe Fossey Fund is proud to be the world’s largest organization dedicated to gorilla conservation.

Three programs are emerging as key priorities for the upcoming year: Stormwater Stewards, Youth Fellows, and Youth Summits. \n\nUnder the Stormwater Stewards program, we have completed 14 rain garden installations across seven school districts. This spring alone, over 650 students joined us for five work parties across the region. During these days of engagement, classrooms and student clubs spearhead various projects, from designing the garden to supplemental activities, such as high school students taking leadership roles while working with elementary school students. \n\nEarthGen’s summits catalyze and energize youth. We have already hosted two in 2025, one in Clark County and one in Pierce County, with additional summits planned for the fall. At each summit, hundreds of students come together to share their projects and learn new ways to engage in environmental action and stewardship. Another key way EarthGen delivers its mission is through the Youth Fellows program. In the upcoming year, plans are in place to work closely with a cohort of students, supporting them to inspire change through existing EarthGen programming and within their own communities. In short, we will continue to partner with youth to implement, refine, and refresh our programming to best meet the needs of the next generation.", "Request": 10000.0, "SupportType": "General Operating Support", "Project_Name": null, "Project_Description": null, "Funding_Impact": "These funds will be used for general operating support, which will be allocated towards all of EarthGen’s programs, with a particular focus on the Puget Sound, Southwest Washington, and Yakima County.

The people we serve are primarily low-income, live alone, and live with disabilities. They can’t afford services such as transportation or help around the house.\n\nFor over 28 years, we have mobilized community volunteers  to provide free, practical assistance to older adults (ages 55+) in East King County so they can continue living safely and comfortably in their homes as long as possible.\n\nWe began in 1997 as part of the national “Faith in Action” movement, which called on local groups to support older adults falling through the cracks of traditional social services. Our initial programs were developed to support older adults in the Issaquah and Sammamish communities in East King County. In 2008, we became an independent 501(c)(3)  nonprofit and adopted the name Eastside Friends of Seniors. Today, we serve more than 200 older adults annually—and we’re expanding to meet growing needs in the rural communities of the Snoqualmie Valley in East King County.\n\nOur trained volunteers provide:\n*Door-to-door transportation to medical appointments and to access food and other critical services\n*Help with household upkeep such as cleaning, organizing, small repairs, and yard work\n*Companionship and social visits\n*Technology support\n*Referrals to other critical services\n\nAll services are free and tailored to the individual’s needs. Our clients’ average age is 82. Nearly all live alone (97%), 60% are low-income, and 80% live with at least one disability.\n\nOur strength lies in our corps of 215 dedicated volunteers. We match clients with volunteers who can best meet their needs and speak their preferred language—with our clients and volunteers often forming lasting, meaningful relationships.\n\nOur clients report that our services dramatically improve their quality of life. In our most recent client survey:\n*95% said Eastside Friends of Seniors helped them continue living independently\n*95% reported improved quality of life\n*93% felt less lonely\n\nAs our region ages and affordability declines, our work is more essential than ever. We’re proud to be part of the safety net for East King County’s older adults, ensuring they are supported, connected, and cared for.", "Request": 10000.0, "SupportType": "Project/Purpose", "Project_Name": "Expanding Aging in Place with Dignity Supports to the Rural Snoqualmie Valley", "Project_Description": "This grant will support Eastside Friends of Seniors (EFOS) to expand our services into the rural Snoqualmie Valley of East King County, including North Bend, Snoqualmie, Fall City, Preston, and unincorporated northeastern King County. These communities have high numbers of older adults living alone, with limited access to transportation, home care, or affordable services. Currently, no other organization in this region offers the full range of aging-in-place supports that EFOS provides.\n\nEFOS currently serves over 200 older adults annually in Issaquah and Sammamish. With this funding, we will extend these same critical services to an additional 50 older adults in the Snoqualmie Valley during the grant period. This expansion will be done in partnership with the Mt. Si Senior Center, a trusted local organization offering on-site activities and meals for older adults. EFOS will complement their services by providing:\n*Transportation to medical appointments and essential errands\n*In-home support like cleaning, organizing, minor repairs, and yard work\n*Social connection through visits \n*Referrals to other services in the region\n\nWe will also host small, welcoming social events for older adults who are uncomfortable or unable to attend larger group programming at the senior center. These gatherings offer a supportive environment where older adults can ease into social interaction at their own pace. EFOS volunteers bring their client matches to the events, helping build trust and connections that reduce isolation.\n\nWhy it matters: Older adults in the Snoqualmie Valley are facing serious challenges that threaten their ability to age safely and comfortably in their own homes. A 2024 Mt. Si Senior Center needs assessment found that high living costs, rising property taxes, and a lack of senior-friendly housing are major concerns. Ten percent of surveyed older adults reported seeing friends or family only once a month or less. Transportation is also limited; local transit does not provide rides out of the Valley, leaving many without access to doctors, food banks, and critical services outside of the immediate area.\n\nThis project fills a critical gap and directly supports EFOS’s mission to partner with the community to help older adults live independently and stay socially connected. With this grant, we will ensure that 250 older adults in East King County receive the care they need to age in place with dignity.", "Funding_Impact": "Funding will support the staff time needed to recruit, train, and coordinate volunteers, as well as onboard new older adult clients in the Snoqualmie Valley. It will also allow us to conduct outreach, build community partnerships, and raise awareness among older adults who may not know help is available.\n\nWith this funding, EFOS will provide direct services to an additional 50 older adults in the Snoqualmie Valley during the grant period, bringing our total reach to 250 clients across East King County. The impact of our work will be seen in the improvements to the daily lives, safety, and well-being of the older adults we serve.\n\nEFOS volunteers will provide transportation to medical appointments, to get groceries, and to run essential errands for our older adult clients. They will assist with light home maintenance and offer meaningful social connection through regular visits. These services help rebuild trust and connection, two vital components for aging well in place.\n\nThe Snoqualmie Valley presents unique challenges due to its rural geography. Public transportation is limited and does not connect to services outside the Valley, making it difficult for older adults to reach doctors, food banks, or other essential resources. By mobilizing local volunteers and collaborating with the Mt. Si Senior Center, EFOS will create a localized support system that reduces barriers and increases access.\n\nWe will also host small, low-pressure social gatherings designed for older adults who may not feel comfortable attending larger group programs. These events offer a gentle way to rebuild social skills, reduce isolation, and foster peer connections, with EFOS’s trusted volunteers helping to bridge the gap.\n\nThis grant will have a meaningful impact by extending life-enhancing services to older adults in rural East King County, giving them the connection and support they need to age safely and with dignity in their own homes.", "Org_Budget": 259442.0, "Org_Budget_Upload": "https://wewocknerfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/ninja-forms/4/EFOS-2024-Statement-of-Activity-and-2025-Budget.pdf", "Project Budget": 101028.0, "Project_Budget": "https://wewocknerfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/ninja-forms/4/EFOS_Project-Budget.pdf", "Proj_Budget_Upload": "Below are a few direct quotes from the older adults we serve, sharing the impact of our support on their daily lives, health, and emotional well-being:\n\nOn receiving life-saving medical transportation:\n“You saved my life.

As a mountain rescue unit, our call-outs take us everywhere from technical urban searches (supporting Snohomish County Volunteer Search and Rescue) to remote wilderness areas requiring travel on challenging, often-unmaintained roads. Due to age and heavy use, SAR41 has unfortunately reached the end of its service life. \n\nWe currently use SAR41 to carry everything from medical supplies to hypothermia kits, emergency shelters, communication devices (including GPS and radios), patient transport litters, ropes and rigging equipment, e-bikes (for expedited trailhead access) and more. Recognizing that a replacement vehicle is greatly needed, we have thoroughly researched our options and, in the absence of available county/state funding, plan to purchase a truck through a generous discount offered by Bickford Ford of Snohomish.

It is also a loss for the other organizations that rely on our support, including neighboring mountain rescue units and Mount Rainier National Park, to which we provide team members several weekends each year to staff winter rescue patrols. \n\nBy investing in a new rescue truck, the Foundation would directly empower us to respond to emergencies in a safe and efficient manner, resulting in care for community members in times of great need. This funding would directly serve, and indirectly protect, countless individuals by enabling our all-volunteer team to deliver critical search and rescue services, transport life-saving equipment, and ultimately, bring home lost or injured individuals, whether in technical urban environments or the wilderness. We respond to dozens of call-outs per year as our own mountain rescue unit, in addition to supporting Snohomish County Volunteer Search and Rescue when their call-outs require more technical skills.

Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest. Three hikers, siblings in their 20s from out of state, were stranded at Tin Can Gap, ill-equipped for an unplanned overnight. They had nearly slid down a steep, snow-covered slope and were unable to safely navigate their way down due to thick fog, rain, and snow. The Snohomish County Sheriff’s Office search and rescue coordinator was able to reach the &quot;very wet and cold&quot; hikers via cell phone, confirming their dire situation.\n\nOur immediate response was crucial. Rescue teams rode e-bikes and all-terrain vehicles for eight miles to reach the trailhead, then hiked an additional seven miles through treacherous terrain in order to reach the distressed siblings, finding them hypothermic. The initial team arrived nine hours after the original call and provided urgent medical attention, warm shelter, and sustenance. The severe conditions, including snow, graupel, and low visibility, repeatedly stalled helicopter extraction attempts. This meant a complex, on-foot evacuation was our only option.\n\nThis operation quickly grew, showcasing the vital collaboration between Snohomish County Sheriff/Everett Mountain Rescue (SCSO/EMRU), Seattle Mountain Rescue (SMR), Olympic Mountain Rescue, as well as volunteer search and rescue units from Snohomish, King and Skagit counties. All in all, the rescue took 32 hours, with the initial two teams spending 27 of those hours in the field. Thanks to the dedication, sacrifice and expertise of rescuers, as well as the considerable amount of technical gear provided by our unit, all three siblings survived and made it home. \n\n--\n\nThis mission underscores the critical need for reliable rescue trucks to transport essential equipment to emergencies in remote areas.

The Cafe opened its doors in 2015, joining the Recovery Cafe Network which now consists of over 80 Cafes nationwide. The Recovery Café’s peer support model provides a structure for developing healthy relationships and accountability that empowers Recovery Café Members (most closely-held participants) to gain and maintain recovery, reduce relapse, and strive to reach their full potential. Like other Recovery Community Centers, Recovery Cafés believe that there are many pathways to recovery, and celebrate those who have found a specific approach(es) that works for them.\n\nEverett Recovery Cafe’s founder, Wendy Grove, was first introduced to the Recovery Cafe model as a volunteer at Recovery Cafe Seattle - the original Cafe, founded in 2004. Wendy, seeing the success of this holistic, healing work, brought the Cafe model to Everett. The original location was on Broadway in Everett, a 100-year old, 800 square foot house only able to hold a capacity of 30 members. Within 6 years, Cafe membership was pushing 200, which catapulted the move to a new location on California street. With this new location, Cafe programming now includes kitchen and barista training programs that help prepare Members to reenter the workforce by providing food handler certifications, basic job training, and employment references. Additionally, the Cafe offers Recovery Coaching, a one-on-one program that partners Members with a certified Recovery Coach. Coaches assist Members in developing wellness plans, identifying barriers, and working towards self-established goals. Participation in these programs empowers Members to achieve long-term transformation as a part of a community of peer support.\n\nAs the Cafe celebrates 10 years of operation, membership is over 300, with 33 peer support groups (known as Recovery Circles) held per week, and over 1,600 meals served each month. Over the last two years, more than 1,400 Members have accessed the Cafe’s services.

Everett Recovery Cafe welcomes anyone aged 18 and over to be a guest for the day, but the Cafe is not a drop-in center. Cafe Membership is offered at no-cost, but participants (Members) are held lovingly accountable to certain criteria. Members agree to (1) Be alcohol and drug-free in the Cafe’s space, (2) Attend a weekly peer support group known as a Recovery Circle, (3) Be an active participant in the Cafe Community.\n\nA typical day at the Cafe begins with a midday meal of soup and salad, available to all Members and guests at no cost. By beginning the day with a warm meal, we address the food insecurity faced by many of our Members. Additionally, our lunch service provides a safe, community-building environment. The Cafe’s Recovery Specialists, trained in active listening, motivational interviewing, and trauma-informed techniques, use this time to engage with Members to identify needs and strengthen relationships. Members work with Recovery Specialists to establish new skills, connect with local resources, and build relationships. Everett Recovery Cafe’s peer support programing includes:\n - Recovery Circles - These peer-to-peer support groups are the heart of the Cafe, where small groups of 8-10 people meet weekly to check-in, share resources, and become known and loved.\n - School for Recovery - Everett Recovery Cafe offers classes aimed at improving life skills, enhancing self-care, developing self-awareness, and providing new recreational/social options (e.g. yoga, art, music). Classes are taught by staff, volunteers, or Members who have demonstrated stability and skills that they wish to share with the Community.\n - Direct Access to Community Services - The Cafe partners with over 30 local service providers to assist our Members in accessing wrap-around services. Many service providers work within the Cafe’s healing space, to directly connect with Members.\n\nOne of the most powerful pieces of the Cafe’s Peer Support Recovery Program is Member empowerment.

This includes individuals who have been recently released from incarceration, are experiencing homelessness, or are engaged in treatment programs.\n\nIn 2024, Everett Recovery Cafe served 945 Members. Of that membership, 92% experienced alcohol or drug-related addictions, 68% experienced homelessness, and 71% experienced unemployment. Membership consists of adults of diverse gender identities, ethnicities, and cultural backgrounds. While we do not restrict services based on socioeconomic status, the majority of Cafe Members have little or no income.\n\nThe peer-to-peer aspect of recovery support is fundamental to Everett Recovery Café's success. “Active engagement in peer support groups has shown to be a key predictor of...sustaining recovery.” (Tracy and Wallace, 2016) The power of peer support is in people using their own lived experiences and educational growth to help each other, in a way that strengthens individual relationships and empowers those who come here seeking help to share what they have learned with our community. Some of the advantages of peer-to-peer recovery support are:\n- Healthy behavior modeling from peer leaders\n- Enhanced sense of community and belonging\n- Increases in confidence, self-esteem, and the ability to cope with challenges\n- Increasing hope (89% of survey respondents say Café membership has increased the amount of hope in their lives)", "Org_Budget": 1669641.0, "Org_Budget_Upload": "https://wewocknerfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/ninja-forms/4/ERC-Simplified-budget-2025.pdf", "Project Budget": 1232880.0, "Project_Budget": "https://wewocknerfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/ninja-forms/4/2025-Peer-Recovery-Support-Budget.pdf", "Proj_Budget_Upload": "Snohomish County’s 2025 Point-In-Time count found that, of the 1,161 currently unhoused people in the county, 21% were over the age of 55.

The Cafe’s elder Members share unique knowledge, wisdom, and life experiences that help foster shared respect, loving accountability, and continual growth amongst our membership. We see this in small ways, such as reminders about using manners and holding respectful conversation, or large ways, when we listen to their stories of resiliency, loss and perseverance. Our elder Members drive participation in social activities, such as book clubs, art classes and card game tournaments, and are frequently the first to volunteer for community tasks. Leading by example, their active involvement has encouraged an increase in participation among other Members. The Cafe is honored to be a trusted source of community support for our elders.\n\nAdditional Financial Information: Approximately 70% of our 2024 Operating Budget comes from the Washington State Health Care Authority State Opioid Response, Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment, and Substance Use Disorder Grants.

This project builds upon the success of our Canyon Park clinic—a model that brings mental health professionals directly into the primary care environment. Patients can receive therapy and psychiatric support in the same setting where they see their trusted physicians, removing barriers such as stigma, long wait times, and complicated referral processes.\n\nThe new Kirkland clinic will serve youth (ages 12+), adults, and older adults—groups increasingly impacted by the growing mental health crisis. With this expansion, EvergreenHealth will add multiple full-time therapists and begin offering more than 1,000 therapy sessions and 150 psychiatry visits annually to 350–400 new patients in the first year alone.\n\nThis project is not just about adding services—it’s about transforming how behavioral health is delivered. Primary care is often the first place patients seek help, but historically, mental health has been siloed. Our integrated model closes that gap by embedding behavioral health into the clinical workflow. Providers collaborate closely, patients receive faster and more coordinated care, and outcomes improve across the board.\n\nThe demand is urgent. Long wait times, provider shortages, and rising rates of depression, anxiety, and suicide—especially among youth and older adults—have made mental health access one of the most pressing healthcare challenges of our time. At EvergreenHealth, we believe that mental health is fundamental to whole-person care. Launching this new clinic directly supports our mission of “enriching the health and well-being of every life we touch.”\n\nAs a community-owned hospital system, we are uniquely positioned to create accessible, sustainable solutions. Philanthropic investment is what makes this work possible. While the clinic will be self-sustaining over time through professional billing and institutional support, startup funding is essential to bring this model to new communities.\n\nThe success of the Canyon Park clinic has shown us what’s possible: reduced emergency room visits, earlier intervention, improved patient and provider satisfaction, and better outcomes. The Kirkland expansion will multiply that impact—offering a lifeline to those in crisis, relieving pressure on overwhelmed care teams, and helping our community heal.\n\nThis project is not just a purchase. It is a promise—to treat behavioral health as essential health, and to meet our community where they are, with the care they need and deserve.", "Funding_Impact": "A $500,000 grant from the William E.

The clinic has dramatically reduced average wait times from up to 90 days for external referrals to within 14 days—ensuring patients receive timely care when they need it most.\nA second clinic would be expected to serve an additional 350–400 new patients in its first year, with more than 1,000 therapy sessions and 150 psychiatry visits. This integrated model brings behavioral health care directly into the primary care model, removing barriers such as stigma, access and care coordination gaps. Patients are seen by trusted clinicians in a familiar environment, and primary care providers can seamlessly refer patients to mental health services within their own clinic.\nThis funding would allow us to:\n•\tExpand a proven model into an additional clinic in Kirkland in 2026\n•\tHire multiple new  full-time therapists\n•\tProvide care for adolescents (12+), working adults, and older individuals\n•\tIntervene earlier to reduce ED visits, crisis episodes, and hospitalization\n•\tSupport overburdened primary care providers with accessible mental health solutions\nWe’ve already seen the ripple effects of success at Canyon Park: higher patient satisfaction, improved provider morale, and better clinical outcomes.

Our mission is to promote positive long-term outcomes for children, families, and communities navigating economic injustice across King County. We advance intersectional equity by providing free advocacy services for children involved in family law cases, connecting families to support services, and driving transformational systems change.  \n\nEach year, Family Law CASA supports over 160 children from low-income families across King County through our Child Advocacy Program, which relies on trained volunteer Court- Appointed Special Advocates (CASAs) and attorneys. We are appointed by judges at both King County family courthouses (Kent and downtown Seattle), and 100% of our cases involve serious safety concerns. More than 80% of the parents in our cases lack legal representation or can only access partial support, making our services critical to ensuring that children’s voices are heard.  \n\nFamily Law CASA is the only program in King County, WA that provides comprehensive, court-based child advocacy services entirely free of charge. Our model includes attorney oversight, in-home visits, interpretation and translation services, and trauma-informed training for our volunteers. This holistic, equity-driven approach ensures that vulnerable children have a consistent, informed voice in court during some of the most difficult moments of their lives.  \n\nSince inception, we have served over 3,500 children and consistently delivered high-quality, trauma-informed legal advocacy. Our recommendations are adopted by the court in 93% of cases, demonstrating our credibility and impact in advancing child safety and well-being. In a recent survey, 88% of families reported their children were doing better at case closure.  \n\nAlthough CASA is a nationally recognized model, Family Law CASA is the only independent nonprofit CASA Program in the U.S. focused exclusively on family law. Despite our close relationship with the King County Superior Court, we receive no funding from the Court and minimal city-level government support.  \n\nWe are a proud member of the Washington Race Equity & Justice Initiative (REJI), with 58% of families served identifying as BIPOC and 13% requiring language access services.

Wockner Foundation to support the general operations of our Child Advocacy Program, which provides free, child-centered legal advocacy for children from low-income families navigating complex custody cases in King County, WA. These funds will help ensure that more than 160 children—most under age 11 and facing serious risks to their well-being due to domestic violence, substance use, neglect, or mental health concerns—have a consistent, trusted voice in court as their future is being decided.  \n\nOur program exclusively serves children who would otherwise lack meaningful representation. Last year, 100% of families served were low-income, 63% identified as families of color, and 13% required language access services. Over 80% of parents in our cases are without legal representation or can only secure partial support. Without intervention, children in these circumstances face long-term harm and trauma. \n\nA grant from the William E. Wockner Foundation will help us assign trained volunteer Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASAs) to 160–170 children annually, supervise and support more than 125 active volunteers, and provide interpretation and access services for families with limited English proficiency. CASAs contribute 75 to 150 hours to each case—visiting homes, interviewing key contacts, and preparing detailed Safe Plan Reports with trauma-informed custody and visitation recommendations. These reports are critical to informed judicial decisions and are adopted by the court 93% of the time. CASAs are supported by a professional team of attorneys, staff, and interpreters to ensure culturally responsive and legally sound advocacy.  \n\nWe are the only program in King County offering comprehensive, court-based child advocacy services entirely free of charge, including attorney support, home visits, interpretation, and trauma-informed volunteer training. By comparison, Family Court Services is only free to families earning under $60,000/year, and private Guardian ad Litem services are cost prohibitive. Family Law CASA closes this access-to-justice gap for families earning up to $128,160/year.  \n\nOur model works: 88% of families report their children are doing better at case closure.

We prioritize early intervention, often before a family ever enters shelter, and walk alongside them from the first destabilizing moment through securing housing and, for up to two years afterward, helping them build the skills, stability, and support needed to sustain it long term.\n\nThis model is transforming outcomes in Spokane County. In 2024 alone, FPS prevented homelessness for 976 individuals and helped 805 people—including 449 children from 235 families—exit homelessness into permanent housing. For over two years, nearly 50% of all family exits to permanent housing in Spokane County occurred through FPS programs. Moreover, 96% of families remained housed one year after securing housing. \n\nFPS has become a nationally recognized leader in systems change. We were selected to partner with the University of Notre Dame’s LEO Project to pilot diversion services that reduce reliance on shelter and improve the efficiency of the homeless response system. By combining evidence-based strategies with deep community partnerships and trauma-informed care, we are building a future where families not only escape homelessness but are equipped to thrive for generations.", "Request": 50000.0, "SupportType": "General Operating Support", "Project_Name": null, "Project_Description": null, "Funding_Impact": "FPS is requesting $50,000 in general operating support to continue providing Spokane County's most effective housing-first solutions for families at-risk of or experiencing homelessness.

Initial pursuit of conservation properties is often urgent, complex and resource intensive. Forterra’s Project Pursuits Program enables us to act quickly – meeting property owners and communities where they are, assessing feasibility, and charting strategic next steps. \n\nThis work entails responding to inquiries, researching landowner and property characteristics, evaluating funding feasibility, engaging with interested parties, determining the optimal outcome, and applying for acquisition grants. Sometimes, our role may be as simple as offering information on referrals, or as involved as structuring acquisitions, raising bridge financing, and preparing detailed materials to funders. At other times, Forterra must scramble to raise interim financing to secure a property at risk of imminent conversion. \n\nA single pursuit typically requires 8–16 staff hours across our project and leadership teams, with complex efforts involving external consultants and months or even years of engagement. Critically, these early-stage costs are not covered by public acquisition grants, yet they are essential to securing land that aligns with our mission. \n\nFour current examples of properties at urgent risk of conversion illustrate this diverse and important work: \nThe 50-acre Bastyr Campus adjacent to Saint Edwards State Park is listed for sale due to post-pandemic financial difficulties. The current administration has sought out help from Forterra and the community to maintain the university’s presence and preserve the ecological and community benefits of this $50M+ campus. \nThe 240-acre Lake Riley property is facing a generational ownership transition and is significant to both the Stillaguamish Tribe and the Sons of Norway. The Tribe seeks to restore their ancestral lands for cultural and ecological stewardship. The Sons of Norway seek a partnership that supports preserving the site for youth heritage programming. Forterra is supporting this budding partnership to preserve cultural heritage, connect with ancestors, and conserve the property in perpetuity. \nThe Bartelheimer family has farmed this 484-acre farm in Snohomish County since the 1800s. To protect the farm from conversion and to invest in needed upgrades they are interested in selling their development rights. Forterra is helping the landowner navigate the County’s complex, market-based conservation program. \nFriends of Badger Mtn. – For thirty years, local volunteers have led conservation and stewardship efforts in the Tri-Cities area.

Wockner Foundation will support at least five project pursuits.  \n\nConservation of any of these properties immediately protects the environment and serves hundreds of thousands of Washington residents for generations to come. This work safeguards critical ecosystems that provide wildlife habitat, carbon sequestration, water filtration, and heat mitigation. Each protected property also provides community benefits such as public health and safety, and access to recreation and natural areas. \n\nOur decades-long work in the Chehalis Basin has improved air and water quality and safeguarded habitat, contributing to healthy salmon runs and addressing the well-being of Northwest tribes. Working with partners, our work has resulted in one of the largest pink salmon runs of the last 15 years. This year’s run is estimated to be 7.76 million fish, which is 70% above the 10-year average. These numbers represent monumental success and are an example of the type of impact the Wockner Foundation funding would support.  \n\nFrom a financial impact perspective, each dollar of private philanthropy leverages at minimum ten dollars of real estate value within Forterra’s budget.

Advances in genetic technology and genetic counseling of results can allow vulnerable adults and children to access life-saving care and essential medical and support services. For example, identifying a genetic predisposition to colon cancer can prompt earlier screening and the removal of polyps before cancer develops. Similarly, a prenatal or postnatal genetic diagnosis can connect children and families to early interventions, medical care, and community support services that improve long-term outcomes. Importantly, a growing number of genetic findings—especially related to cancer and childhood-onset conditions—can lead to targeted therapies with better health outcomes and fewer side effects. \n\nAs a Washington-based nonprofit, GSF serves patients across the Pacific Northwest and nationally by providing compassionate genetic counseling services and coordinating clinical genetic testing.

Susan Roden, Counselor at Highline’s Shorewood Elementary, recently shared:\n\n“Girls Inc. at Shorewood Elementary has been a tremendous gift to both our students, their families, and our staff. The girls who participate in the program have blossomed throughout the year(s). They are excited to meet with the facilitators and their peers every week. The skills they have learned has led the girls to greater self-esteem, strong self-confidence, acceptance of self and others and a strong sense of community. Our school’s mission, Empower students to become lifelong learners who are responsible, caring, and contributing members of their community, has been enhanced by Girls Inc.   \n\nAs the school counselor at Shorewood, I have had the privilege to work alongside the fabulous staff of Girls Inc. The staff has been open to supporting initiatives within our comprehensive school counseling program. The moment I mentioned that I wanted to offer our Hispanic students an opportunity to focus on their personal dreams for the future through an art activity, the Girls Inc. staff was all in! They brought great energy, ideas, time, and dedication to ensuring that the program would be a success for over 100 students. This year I will be working with them to enhance a leadership opportunity for our fifth graders prior to their transition to middle school.

Good health and nutrition are important throughout life. For seniors, a good diet can help to reduce the risk of developing osteoporosis, obesity, high blood pressure, heart disease, cancer, gastrointestinal problems, and chronic under-nutrition. \n\nGMVCC provides nutrition services through both Congregate Meals at our Community Center, and home delivered meals through Meals on Wheels: Congregate Meals are offered at noon every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, with transportation to and from the center available.

These times are so much more than a meal, providing invaluable socialization for many isolated seniors in our community. All our meals are catered by a local small business and designed specifically for the unique nutritional and dietary needs of older adults. The cost to prepare each meal is just $13.

A good diet also increases resistance to illness and disease, and reduce the risk of heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure, type-2 diabetes, bone loss, cancer, and anemia.\n•\tOptimize mental health and well-being; many studies have linked nutrition with mental health and acuity for people of all ages. For seniors this becomes particularly important as it helps reduce the risk of diseases such as Alzheimer’s. \n•\tCommunity connections; GMVCC meals are offered in an inviting communal setting that promotes socialization and networking among community members.

In 2023, HopeSparks’ CEO Joe Le Roy was honored as Non-Profit Leader of the Year by the University of Washington – Tacoma’s Milgard School of Business, and in 2025, he was honored by Kids’ Mental Health Pierce County with a 2025 Partner of Excellence Award.", "Request": 15000.0, "SupportType": "Project/Purpose", "Project_Name": "HopesCloset", "Project_Description": "HopeSparks’ basic needs boutique HopesCloset provides a warm, welcoming environment and a dignified shopping experience. The goal of HopesCloset is to ensure that every family has what they need to take care of their children and create secure parent-child relationships. HopeSparks’ early intervention, mental health, and family support services address children’s social/emotional and developmental needs. HopesCloset helps to meet their other needs. By shopping at HopesCloset, families are able to save money which helps them to better afford food, housing, utilities, and transportation. Parents and caregivers build confidence as they are able to provide stability for their children. This aligns with HopeSparks’ mission to strengthen families.\n\nAt HopesCloset, families are able to shop for new and gently-used clothing, coats, shoes, socks, underwear, and pajamas, as well as diapers, wipes, school supplies, gifts, and hygiene items. HopesCloset is part of a network of diaper banks supported by the Pierce County Early Childhood Network (PCECN). HopeSparks receives diapers and wipes from PCECN and distributes them to families through HopesCloset as well as at HopeSparks’ South Union Avenue location. We also receive items donated to HopesCloset by individuals and businesses that conduct drives for clothing, diapers, and gifts. When funds allow, HopeSparks purchases items families need such as a specific high chair for a child with eating challenges.\n\nHopesCloset is operated by a full-time program coordinator and approximately 50 volunteers a year, some of whom are also clients. Volunteers sort clothing, and help families select clothing, diapers, and basic needs items. HopesCloset's annual operating budget is $120,000 and includes staff salary and benefits, purchased items for families, and support payments for families with emergent needs who do not qualify under other HopeSparks programs. We do not attach a value to the large volume of donated items.\n\nAll of HopesCloset’s services and resources are free for families. The program is entirely supported by grants, individual contributions, and in-kind donations. Funds from the Wockner Foundation would go toward HopesCloset operating expenses and also help us to purchase items for families who would otherwise go without needed items. We have had recent requests for a specialized car seat, and a two-child stroller but the discretionary funds we have set aside are very low.", "Funding_Impact": "A grant from the William E.

We anticipate more than 5,500 individuals will be served by year-end, and up to 6,000 individuals will be served in 2026. We anticipate that 60,000 items will be distributed this year including 25,600 articles of clothing and shoes, 14,400 diapers and wipes, and 20,000 personal hygiene items, toiletries, cleaning supplies, birthday and holiday gifts, gift cards, and other miscellaneous items.\n\nHopeSparks will determine if HopesCloset is successful based on our ability to help our families to meet their basic needs. Each month, we track and record the number of unduplicated families, unduplicated individuals, and unduplicated children, the number of appointments, and the number of items distributed. Distributed items are tracked separately as coats, shoes, socks/undergarments, pajamas, clothing items, seasonal clothing, diapers, wipes, basic needs items, food items, gifts, other miscellaneous items, and gift cards.\n\nHopesCloset addresses health-related social needs and inequities by helping low-income families to meet their basic needs.

These communities successfully met conservation compliance requirements, ensuring no retaliatory killings of snow leopards or wild prey, which triggered an additional $5,480 in conservation bonuses. On average, each artisan earned $134, providing a critical income source in remote, economically marginalized areas. These funds will help expand SLE to additional communities, enhance artisan training, and boost market access, enabling more families to benefit from conservation-linked income.\n\nIn addition to livelihoods, funds will support community-based tourism development in at least 10 communities across the four countries. This includes training and equipping communities to offer sustainable tourism experiences that generate income while promoting conservation.\nIn conservation education, funds will support programming for youth in remote mountain regions. Recently, 484 students participated in 24 ecocamps and 38 nature club activities, helping to build a foundation of environmental awareness and stewardship among the next generation.\nFunds will also strengthen scientific monitoring, a key pillar of conservation planning.

Founded in 2017, by retired shipyard engineer Joel Adamson, KHOC aims to end homelessness in Kitsap County by pairing housing with comprehensive services that address its root causes. \n\nJoel was struck by how many individuals experiencing homelessness were seniors and people with disabilities, who despite having some income, struggled to qualify for leases, afford deposits, and navigate the housing process. With community support, Joel piloted an innovative housing shared model, by creating master leases with local homeowners for 3-to-6 bedroom homes and sublettings the rooms to individuals experiencing homelessness and housing insecurity for an affordable fee. This efficient model leverages existing housing stock and suits the needs of Kitsap County, while avoiding the high costs and long timelines of building new housing.  After several years, KHOC hired Executive Director Scott Willard. Under Scott’s leadership, KHOC developed our in-house case management and mental health programs, which help our residents and program participants find and maintain safe, stable housing.  \n\nAnnually, KHOC serves 500 residents and program participants through three core programs:  \n\n1) Affordable Housing: We operate 22 shared homes throughout Kitsap County, in which residents live communally and provide mutual support to each other using WAQRR-accredited recovery and permanent supportive housing models.\n\n 2) Case Management: We offer personalized case management for residents and community members experiencing homelessness and housing insecurity, providing referrals to housing, healthcare, and other critical services.\n\n3) Mental Health Services: We offer counseling and mental health support to both residents and case management participants. \n\nMany of our residents and program participants experience homelessness and housing instability caused by poverty, domestic violence, disability, and chronic health conditions.

Residents have access to case management, mental health, and service referrals. Since homelessness is traumatic and isolating, we pay special attention to helping residents rebuild their community and increase social connectedness. KHOC uses a permanent supportive housing model. People can live in our homes as long as they would like; many people use our homes as a springboard to move on to other opportunities and thrive independently.  \n\nWith stable housing and mental health supports, individuals can better focus on addressing other needs like mental health care, substance use recovery, or workforce development, empowering them to build more stable, independent futures.\n\nKHOC funds our programming through rental income, government funding, and private donations and grants. However, rental income and public funding do not cover the full cost of our housing and wrap-around services, making private support crucial. Many of our residents struggle to pay rent on time and in full, especially if they are moving in from homelessness or living on limited fixed incomes. This often leads to avoidance out of shame and fear, and can snowball into residents getting far behind on rent. This is particularly a challenge in our recovery houses, where residents are recovering from Substance Use Disorder and focusing on maintaining sobriety and finding employment. Additionally, some residents find move-in costs can be a barrier, especially when moving in from homelessness or living \non limited fixed incomes. \n\nPrivate funding helps us bridge the gap, allowing us to assist residents with move-in costs and help cover rent for residents facing financial hardship.

Our goal is to ensure that the children in our programs today are the last generation in their family to experience homelessness. \n\nOver time, we have grown in our capacity to meet the continuously changing needs of families through a variety of housing interventions alongside wraparound support. Having a safe place to sleep is critical, but we recognize that housing is just the first step in someone’s journey out of homelessness. We began our Parent Support Program in 2015 and started our Mental Health Program in 2017 to support comprehensive health and healing while addressing the complex trauma that comes with experiencing homelessness. In 2024, we launched our Prevention Program, designed to stop homelessness before it begins by helping vulnerable families retain housing.\n\nIn 2024, Lydia Place served over 300 households (including 423 children), conducted 928 parent support meetings, and provided 1,978 therapy sessions.\n\nDuring our most recent reporting period, 70% of families exiting our programs moved into permanent housing, and the majority of clients who responded to exit surveys reported increases in their sense of community and their hope for the future of their family.\n\nOne of the most powerful reflections of our success is seen in the journey of a single mother who enrolled in our Family Housing Program in 2021. By 2023, she had secured a part-time job and started volunteering at a local nonprofit, driven by a deep desire to give back after receiving support herself when she was homeless.

Families in this program have higher barriers and often have limited income and limited rental history. As a result, they typically face costly deposit fees, ranging from $1,500-2,000 and have few options other than borrowing money from family or friends. To prevent families that are already income-constrained from taking on debt to secure housing, Lydia Place utilizes flexible funding to cover the costs of deposits and application fees as much as possible.

Wockner Foundation to join us as a community partner in support of our critical programs and services, including our three-pronged approach of prevention, outreach, and shelter for families and children experiencing homelessness in our community. \n\nThe first approach, emergency shelter, includes wraparound services to help families move into stable housing as quickly as possible. Shelter is only a temporary solution and with limited beds (500 beds between two shelters), we have to prioritize the most vulnerable families (i.e., kids under the age of 2, those fleeing a domestic violence situation, pregnant individuals, kids with life-threatening medical conditions), ensuring families can stay together safely, with access to resources, housing, employment services, community, and hope. \n\nThe second approach, mobile outreach, meets unsheltered families where they are – in tents, cars, storage units, area hospitals – to address barriers and help families move directly into housing. With flexible funding, we help families move quickly into stable housing, bypassing the need to come into shelter. This innovative diversion approach is cost-effective and has become a national model for providing homelessness services for families. \n\nThe third approach, prevention, works further “upstream” to prevent homelessness before it occurs. Knowing that one of the biggest predictors of future homelessness is past homelessness, we support families who are in danger of losing their homes.  Focused on keeping families housed, we seek to prevent the trauma of homelessness, stop the lifelong repercussions of adverse childhood experiences, and disrupt intergenerational cycles of homelessness.\n\nWith the support of the community, we utilize national best practices and evidence-based models of shelter, wraparound support, and rapid rehousing, taking time to address the unique needs of each family experiencing homelessness.

For example, at our drop-in family resource center, we collaborate with Navos, BrightSpark, and Mercy Housing to provide families a one-stop shop of a suite of services. \n\nOverall, Mary's Place is committed to meeting families and children with the tools and resources they need to move forward to stable housing as quickly and safely as possible, thereby minimizing experienced trauma and disrupting the cycle of generational homelessness.", "Recognition": "Mary’s Place works with funders to acknowledge their support through our social media, events publications, newsletters, and gratitude reports, reaching more than 26,000 subscribers.  \n\nMary’s Place also has two (2) major campaigns with associated events each year – dream BIG in April/May and No Child Sleeps Outside in November/December.

As Washington's largest provider of family emergency shelter, Mary's Place assists families with children to move out of homelessness using national best practices and effective and scalable services. Our innovative three-pronged approach includes 500 beds of emergency family shelter in two locations in King County (Seattle, and Bellevue); mobile outreach to support unsheltered families living in tents and cars, along with a family drop-in resource center for supplies and connections; and homelessness prevention through rental assistance and other stability support to help families keep their permanent housing.\n\nFounded in 1999 as a women’s drop-in day center, Mary’s Place expanded services to encompass emergency shelter for the entire family during the 2008 recession as there were no family shelters in King County at the time.  Since then, thanks to the support of individuals and partners in the community, Mary’s Place continues to flex to meet the ever-changing needs of vulnerable families in our region, providing safety, stability, wraparound services, and support for families experiencing homelessness.  In 2024, we served 1,780 families through our comprehensive programs and services (including 3,167 children), and helped 1,128 families move into or maintain stable housing.", "Request": 100000.0, "SupportType": "Project/Purpose", "Project_Name": "Mary's Place Burien Family Shelter Project", "Project_Description": "Mary’s Place is constructing a new facility to expand county-wide capacity to serve more families and to meet growing needs for shelter and housing. Located in Burien, on the site of our currently operating shelter, the new facility will offer 200 shelter beds, serving about 70 families at a time. Co-located with 90 units of affordable housing, developed and managed by Mercy Housing Northwest, the campus will fill a critical need for 2- and 3-bedroom units to meet the needs of families with children.  This project will affirmatively further fair housing by reducing displacement of lower income families, including BIPOC, immigrant/refugee, and disabled community members. By keeping families grounded in their community and children in their schools, Mary’s Place and Mercy Housing are creating avenues for families to make a stable, successful, and sustainable transition to permanent housing. \n\nWhen Mary’s Place first purchased our Burien site in 2018 – the first property we ever owned – we recognized the potential of the 4.3-acre property for critical future shelter and affordable housing. We are inspired and motivated to have one of our big dreams now becoming reality, thanks to the unwavering support of our community, government, donors, and friends. The new shelter will increase capacity by 50+ beds, be environmentally efficient, less expensive to maintain, and include modern ventilation and HVAC to ensure a safer and healthier environment for guests and staff. When construction began in May 2025, families and services moved to other shelter locations; there was no break in services provided for unsheltered families and no previously sheltered families were returned to homelessness during construction.\n\nIn the new space, Mary’s Place will continue to offer a full continuum of wraparound support including meals, clothing, laundry, and hygiene supplies; housing support (e.g., furniture connections, landlord negotiations, moving costs); employment resources; developmentally appropriate programming for children and teens; clinical and behavioral health resources and referrals; parenting education; and flexible financial assistance to address families' individualized needs related to housing. The Burien shelter will also support our Popsicle Place program for families who have a critically ill child and are experiencing homelessness. Additionally, this location will offer our Baby's Best Start program for pregnant people and new parents experiencing homelessness with infants. Our comprehensive support programs work toward minimizing trauma for families and children and helping to break the generational cycle of homelessness.", "Funding_Impact": "In recent years, the combined effects of increased housing insecurity for families, along with pandemic-related challenges, economic uncertainty, and inflation, have provided Mary’s Place with new opportunities and challenges to remain flexible and responsive as we work hard to fill gaps and meet the needs of families in real time.\n\nWith a focus on ending family homelessness and recognition that homelessness is rooted in longstanding systemic racism, Mary’s Place remains committed to eliminating barriers to access and opportunities for disproportionately impacted populations. In King County, only 7% of people identify as Black, but 41% of families in our shelters are Black and more than 85% are people of color. 41% of our guests have a primary language other than English and about 64% of our families in shelter are seeking asylum. The majority of our guests are children – 58% are under age 18 and 29% are under age 5. Our most recent demographics in our shelters indicate: Black or African American (41%), Hispanic/Latinx (21%), Asian or Paciﬁc Islander (13%), White (11%), multiracial (7%), and American Indian/Alaska Native (2%). Many of the women we serve are fleeing domestic violence (12%) and all the families we serve are low-income – 95% earn less than 30% of the AMI.\n\nAt Mary’s Place, we define success by helping one family at a time meet their own stabilization goals, move from homelessness to safe housing, and enhance their capacity to remain housed. We have a continuous process for evaluating impact, both quantitatively and qualitatively, for short- and long-term results. Frontline specialists collect and document an extensive list of program metrics, such as developmental screenings, health interventions, and housing referrals. We also incorporate qualitative data analysis to center the voice and experience of our guests. We collect exit information as families leave emergency shelter and move to stable housing with questions focused on their interactions, experiences, and services received. We contact families for long-term assessment of housing stability. \n\nThis Burien project will be measured against Mary’s Place mission and desired, as well as the following measurable outcomes:   \n-\tMore families have a place to call home\n-\tMore people move toward safe and stable permanent housing and have access to resources essential for long-term housing stability\n-\tFamilies have increased access to emergency shelter \n-\tFamilies have increased access to affordable housing in South King County\n-\tFamily members improve long-term health and well-being", "Org_Budget": 27020645.0, "Org_Budget_Upload": "https://wewocknerfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/ninja-forms/4/Marys-Place-FY25-Org-Budget-1.pdf", "Project Budget": 38256511.0, "Project_Budget": "https://wewocknerfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/ninja-forms/4/Marys-Place-Burien-Project-Budget-202408.pdf", "Proj_Budget_Upload": "Our Burien Project has been conceptualized with input from community members and stakeholders.

Building design, layout, services, and programming are being informed by a committee of stakeholders that includes neighbors, local service providers, the school district, businesses, faith community, individuals with lived experience of homelessness, and others. This project has also been informed by the City of Burien. The Burien Housing Action Plan indicates that housing costs have risen much faster than incomes in Burien over the last 20 years and there is a critical need for housing. From Puget Sound Regional Council to the South King County Subregion, numerous reports and data points demonstrate that Burien needs to produce more housing at all income levels to meet its growing population as housing is becoming out of reach for a large percentage of the community including families. \n\nThis project offers an innovative approach to both the affordable housing shortage and the growing need for emergency shelter and wraparound support for families experiencing homelessness. Our goal for this project is to create a seamless pathway from shelter to stable housing in an environment where children can thrive, parents are supported, and communities become stronger and more resilient. We believe that the Burien campus will serve as a national model to demonstrate how a comprehensive homelessness solution can address and end the homelessness crisis facing many major cities in the U.S.\n\nFunding from the William E.

Today, NWEdA’s 23 full-time staff and 85 volunteers support 1,000+ young people across the region.\n\nThrough one-to-one mentorship, NWEdA’s Education Advocates help young people address all the life and other barriers to academic success. Our individualized, holistic model supports students as they plan to enter higher education through graduation day. All services are offered free of charge, at the pace and location of a student’s choice.\n\nIn 2019, the Urban Institute published a 3-year study of sites using Jobs for the Future’s Back on Track model, including NWEdA’s work in South King County. The study offered a side-by-side comparison of NWEdA’s outcomes to those at a comparison site in Tacoma not served by the model. Comparison site students were demographically and socially similar to NWEdA’s and in their desire to earn higher education degrees. The study showed NWEdA students enrolled in postsecondary at three times the rate than comparison site students. Young men of color served by NWEdA enrolled at seven times the rate.", "Request": 10000.0, "SupportType": "Project/Purpose", "Project_Name": "Higher Education Success for Disconnected Youth", "Project_Description": "Funding would support 850+ young people in our College Prep and College Success Programs across King County.

We focus on helping marginalized young people succeed at completing degrees and certificates at local community and technical colleges, four-year colleges and universities, and apprenticeship programs through our two linked programs: \n\nOur College Prep Program helps young people prepare for higher education and meaningful employment. NWEdA’s aim is for each student to enroll in an appropriate postsecondary program with the resources and skills they need to succeed. Our Education Advocates work one-on-one with each student to create a career and academic achievement plan tailored to the student’s gifts and goals. As needed, students are connected to high school completion programs or receive help preparing for the GED and college entrance exams; volunteer tutors help students prepare for these tests. \n\nAs students work toward high school credentials and placement exams, EAs help them identify the best academic program for their needs, navigate the education system, apply for a postsecondary program, obtain financial aid and scholarships, address life barriers (housing, childcare, transportation), and effectively access on-and off-campus services.\n\nOur College Success Program serves students postsecondary-enrolled with academic advising; subject specific tutoring; financial aid and scholarship application assistance; connections to professional mentors; and NWEdA’s gap scholarships for housing, childcare, tuition, and more. There is no timeline for students to graduate – a student can receive support from NWEdA as long as it takes to earn a higher education degree.\n\nIn both programs, our Education Advocates meet students where they are on their education pathway and happens one-on-one utilizing a hybrid (in person and virtual) approach with all students. Across both programs, we:\n\n1) Provide low-barrier access to services, welcoming all low-income students, \n2) Offer one-to-one, tailored support, \n3) Work on open-ended timeline, \n4) Have time to develop effective and authentic relationships with students\n5) Meet at multiple sites and locations of student’s choice, and\n6) Can accompany students to financial aid and other on-campus resources.", "Funding_Impact": "NWEdA has a proven track record of improving student outcomes.

We serve as the connective link between the public and wildlife rehabilitators, helping ensure animals in distress receive the care they need. Our mission is to provide safe, humane capture and transport for wild animals when community members are unable to do so, while upholding the highest standards of wildlife handling and compassion. In just three years, OCCRA has grown to cover six counties in the North Willamette Watershed—Clackamas, Multnomah, Washington, Columbia, Yamhill, and most of Marion—through a network of trained volunteers who respond to calls seven days a week. Our work is guided by a commitment to wildlife welfare, public service, and equity of access; we prioritize cases involving low-income, disabled, or elderly callers who cannot transport animals themselves. Since launching, we’ve responded to over 350 calls for help, provided direct support for licensed rehabbers, and equipped more than 85 volunteers with safety gear, training, and field support. We’ve also earned praise from state and local partners, including the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, and are actively collaborating with them on long-term improvements to wildlife response. In 2024, OCCRA launched a school-based wildlife education program, “Wildlife and You,” bringing hands-on learning to hundreds of students. As a grassroots nonprofit, OCCRA has no brick-and-mortar facility; our headquarters are based out of a small rescue farm in Oregon City, and our donations are funneled directly into volunteer gear, transportation equipment, insurance, and technology.

Since 2018, a dedicated, multidisciplinary team at the OHC has provided joint human health and veterinary services to this “human-animal unit.” This form of clinical care creates a positive healthcare experience for people who often are more concerned for the health of their animals than their own health, and whose previous experiences with the health care system have caused trauma. By leading with the offer of free veterinary care, the One Health Clinic creates a healing environment where pet owners may feel safe to access human healthcare for themselves. The integration of human health and veterinary care allows for innovative sharing of key information between health care providers that can improve the health of both humans and animals, including detection of shared health risks in the environment. Ongoing evaluation and research of this unique care model is helping to raise local, national, and international awareness of its potential to help ease the current homelessness crisis. \n\nOur clinics are based in Seattle, Washington. We have worked with a Youth and Young Adult (Y/YA) enhanced emergency shelter New Horizons in Belltown since 2018 and have recently started piloting a clinic out of the DESC-run Hobson Place in Beacon Hill in 2025. Through our free toolkit (onehealthclinic.org), we work with communities nationally and internationally to replicate the model in their regions. \n\nOur data has shown that this model is effective in the Y/YA homeless population. Over a 4- year period, we found (manuscript accepted for publication 05/2025): \n• 50% of patients accessing care for the first time at the OHC had not accessed healthcare for two years prior \n• Of those 50%, 85% accessed follow-up healthcare \n• Over 80% of all clinic visits resulted in human healthcare, including 69% of visits where clients indicated they did not need/want human healthcare at clinic check-in. \n\nThe OHC sees each clinical experience with an individual experiencing homelessness as an accomplishment. We have seen clients enter the clinical space for the first time who are sleeping rough (outdoors) and over time have established healthcare, built relations and entered housing for themselves and their pets.

By providing OHC clinical care at a regular cadence, we will be able to evaluate the success of this model in an adult population. In exploratory clinics held at this site, we know that all clients accessing human and veterinary care will be experiencing homelessness, have recently been housed and/or are at risk of homelessness. The majority will be over 45 years of age with approximately 10% being over the age of 55. Five percent of those served during two of our last clinics are veterans.\n\nIf funded, we anticipate seeing 10-12 owner/pet pairs per clinic, with a total of approximately 132 clinical visits over one year. The goal of the OHC is to not only support people into establishing healthcare for themselves, but also to have them continue to access healthcare following their first encounter. If OHC visits were more consistent at this site, we would like to see that 25% of these clinical visits would be returning patients. \n\nMonthly clinics at the new site would be beneficial for both animal and human health. Many owners bring their animals to the clinic for vaccines, and most vaccines require a booster shot approximately one-month after the first in the series. As we are currently not providing regular care, owners need to source follow up care at another clinic and many pets do not receive those boosters. Depending on the age and vaccine history of the pet, delayed or missed boosters may affect the efficacy of the protection for the animal. The need for booster shots also gives the human health team opportunity to follow up with the owners, and this second clinical visit often creates the cadence for consistent human healthcare.\n\nThere are no other integrated human-veterinary clinics for adults in the City of Seattle. In fact, we are not aware of any active clinics like this occurring in the country though we are supporting other communities to replicate the model.

Since 2012, OMF has delivered integrated programs focused on veteran transition, housing stability, employment readiness, digital inclusion, and whole-family wellness. Initially launched as a for-profit, OMF transitioned to nonprofit status to increase access and expand its mission. In 2023, OMF merged with WestCare Foundation to improve operations, offer staff benefits, and build long-term sustainability. OMF now serves as the official WestCare affiliate for Washington and Oregon.\n\nOMF primarily serves King County, with outreach throughout Snohomish, Pierce, and Thurston Counties. It partners with more than 45 agencies and is embedded in local systems to ensure disconnected veterans receive coordinated services. In Q1 2025 alone, OMF served 242 unique veterans and family members. Significant partnerships include contracts with the U.S. Department of Labor (DYPSI), WA State Department of Commerce (digital literacy), and the King County Veterans Program (outreach and navigation).\n\nAt Joint Base Lewis-McChord (JBLM), OMF conducts early outreach through its Digital Literacy program, helping service members prepare for civilian life. Coaching and case management are led by trusted team members like Missy Anderson, Paul Perez, and Shayla Reese, bringing deep lived experience and credibility. As OMF grows, it is expanding access to behavioral health, rebranding under WestCare OMF, and strengthening national funding capacity.\n\nThis expansion includes the Veteran Success Through Education (VSTE) initiative partnership with Shoreline and Bellevue Colleges. VSTE embeds trained case managers who offer high-touch support well beyond academic advising, including:\n\n• Individualized plans for education, housing, and employment.\n• VA benefits navigation and crisis response.\n• Emergency housing referrals and behavioral health connections.\n• Culturally competent outreach to BIPOC, LGBTQ+, and justice-involved veterans.\n\nFunding from the King County Veterans Program only partially supports these positions.

This project will fund two part-time, embedded case manager positions, one at Shoreline Community College and one at Bellevue College, to deliver individualized, high-touch support to student veterans navigating housing instability, financial hardship, and gaps in behavioral health access.\n\nEach case manager provides direct assistance in the form of VA benefits navigation, emergency housing referrals, crisis stabilization, and culturally responsive care for BIPOC, LGBTQ+, women, and justice-involved veterans. Shoreline's model has already proven effective, and Bellevue College has formally requested OMF’s support to bring the same structure to its campus. This expansion is projected to serve 250 veterans and family members by June 2027.\n\nThis project is essential to advancing OMF’s mission of helping veterans forge new, effective paths in family, work, and life. Our team understands that many student veterans face unique barriers to civilian reintegration, often juggling school with housing instability, trauma recovery, or underemployment. Without embedded support, they may disengage from school or miss out on available services. This case management initiative directly addresses those risks, ensuring no veteran is left navigating systems alone.\n\nThe program fits squarely within OMF’s broader suite of services, which includes digital readiness, employment coaching, and community reintegration.

With culturally responsive training, each case manager is equipped to serve historically underserved populations, including BIPOC, LGBTQ+, women, and justice-involved veterans, ensuring that equity is not just a principle but a practice.\n\nThe impact of this funding will be both measurable and personal. Case managers will help veterans:\n\n• Navigate the VA system to access benefits and healthcare.\n• Secure emergency housing and referrals to mental health providers.\n• Resolve crises that might otherwise derail academic progress.\n\nDevelop individualized service plans to support long-term goals in education, employment, and wellness.\n\nBy reducing barriers to stability and success, the program addresses a critical gap for student veterans transitioning into civilian life. Other grants fund outreach materials, reporting infrastructure, and licensing for UniteUs, ensuring all services are documented in real time and aligned with equity benchmarks. These platforms allow OMF to generate demographic dashboards, track referral outcomes, and evaluate case-level impact for quarterly reporting.\n\nThe Shoreline model has already demonstrated its value, with staff serving dozens of veterans each quarter and successfully coordinating cross-agency care.

A major regional medical center serving the Eastside community since 1960, Overlake provides comprehensive health services, from prevention and wellness outreach efforts to life-saving emergency and acute care. Overlake is the Eastside hub of well-coordinated, high quality, patient-focused care, with primary, specialty and urgent care clinics close to where people live and work, a full range of emergency services available around the clock, and a broad network of affiliated care providers. We serve over 200,000 people each year.\n\nGeographic Area\nOverlake serves the entire Eastside and beyond, stretching into Snohomish County. This includes residents of the dense urban core as well as those residing in less populated areas. \n\nThe Eastside is a racially and socioeconomically diverse area. Bellevue has been identified as a majority-minority city, meaning that less than half the population is white. And while there are pockets of affluence on the Eastside, there are also pockets in which over 30% of residents are below 200% of the federal poverty line, in spite of the very high cost of living across the Puget Sound region. Overlake serves individuals across the entire spectrum.\n\n\nCurrent Programs and Accomplishments\nOverlake is a 349-bed, nonprofit regional medical center offering a wide spectrum of advanced medical services to the Puget Sound Region. These include a level III trauma center, state-of-the-art diagnostic and therapeutic services for cardiac and cancer patients, and a full range of mental health services. Patients tell us that Overlake is just the right size—big enough to provide care for nearly any medical need but small enough to retain a personal, family feel. Our network of primary care clinics includes one solely focused on the health needs of seniors.\n\nOverlake Medical Center Foundation\nThe Foundation’s mission is to engage the community to support Overlake and strengthen its ability to provide exceptional medical care for generations to come.

We manage 175 acres, including 40 acres of prairie, 30 acres of forest, and over 5 acres of oak savannah, with the long-term restoration goal of converting about 80% of the remaining abandoned agricultural land to prairie and oak savannah.  \n\nAs part of ecological restoration, PRI has worked on the recovery of the golden paintbrush (Castilleja levisecta). Placed on the endangered species list in 1997, the golden paintbrush was delisted from the Washington endangered species list in 2023. At PRI, we have created a seed bed for the golden paintbrush with 5 isolated genetic strands found on Whidbey Island, allowing for cross pollination and creating a better seed.  PRI is one of the only sources for golden paintbrush seeds, and we also provide live plugs for out planting at restoration sites, and mixed pots with one to two host plants for educational and small-scale gardens. \n\nWith recovery of the golden paintbrush underway, PRI and our partners are beginning work on recovery efforts for the Taylor’s checkerspot (Euphydryas editha taylori) butterfly.  PRI’s prairie, which includes 4 acres of land that was never plowed, has been praised by our partners as one of the best prairies in the North Sound area, and we are excited to be the North Sound Hub for the Taylor’s checkerspot butterfly recovery.  \n\nAnother part of our ecological restoration is healing the connection between people and the land.  We accomplish this through our expanding relationship with local tribes and tribal organizations, including the Coast Salish Youth Coalition (CSYC).  PRI has been the host site for the CSYC’s spring Camas Dig and Bake event, with over 200 attendees during the four-day event in 2025.

Most of this grant would be used for the purchase of seeds, plugs, and bulbs used to directly reintroduce native species to the land after it has been prepared through light herbicide treatments, mowing, cutting, and weeding the area.  Herbicide treatments will be controlled and target stubborn invasive species including Himalayan blackberries.  \n\nIn a study published in 2019, Yi Yang, Daivid Tilman, George Furey, and Clarence Lehman found that restoration of grassland biodiversity accelerates the rate of carbon sequestration in soil compared to the degraded and abandoned lands left behind by agriculture. This 22-yearlong study found concentration of carbon in soil, both through 20 cm and through 60 cm, was improved with an increase in perennial species planted (Yang, Y., et al. Soil carbon sequestration accelerated by restoration of grassland biodiversity. Nat Commun 10, 718 (2019)).   \n\nAt PRI, our goal is to increase the number of perennial species through the restoration and expansion of native prairies, restoring the habitat and species found therein, and providing a carbon sink to help combat climate change.  \n\nAs our prairie grows, PRI’s capacity to support other restoration efforts through the production of native seeds and live plants will also grow.  Many of the seeds produced for restoration work is collected from our prairie or native plant center where we grow over 30 species of native plants.  \n\nAdditionally, the growth of our prairie will help support our work with the local Coast Salish tribes and the CSYC, through the spread of camas and other traditional food sources in the expanded prairie.  Camas, bare-stemmed biscuit-root, spring-gold, and nodding onion are just some of the traditional food plants included in seed mixtures PRI uses for prairie restoration.   \n\nThree other species included in the seed mix will be golden paintbrush, yarrow, and woolly sunflower.  Being a hemi parasitic plant, the golden paintbrush will establish itself but attaches its roots to another perennial plant for additional nutrients and water.  At PRI, we’ve found that yarrow and woolly sunflower help support the golden paintbrush without competing for sunlight due to different growth patterns.", "Funding_Impact": "Funding for prairie restoration projects serves all of Whidbey Island’s residents and visitors, as we have over 2 miles of trails open daily to the public.   \n\nThe visitors receiving the greatest impact are our tribal partners and the Coast Salish Youth Coalition. This is because camas, a cornerstone species in the prairie habitat, is not fast food.  In addition to needing upwards of 48 hours to slowly bake, it can take between 4-12 years for the flower to bloom after the seed has been planted.  This is because the plant spends those first years developing the bulb.  However, camas cannot be harvested until flower blooms, ensuring that the plant harvested is camas, and not the similarly appearing death camas (Toxicoscordion venenosum).  Expanding the prairie allows for rotational gathering of camas and other edible plants. The current size of CSYC’s Camas bake event is over 200 participants, and we wish to maintain and grow that number for as long as the prairie can support the activity.  \n\nOther visitors to Pacific Rim Institute include school groups, outdoor enthusiasts, birders, dog-walkers, community groups, and more.  Each visitor who walks our prairie trails during the spring bloom season sees into the past of the land. During the spring and fall, many visitors also return home with their own native plants to include in ornamental or pollinator gardens.  \n\nPRI sees about 1000-2000 visitors a year.

In the early 1800’s, it is estimated that prairie habitat covered 180,000 acres in Western Washington, and 8,000 acres on Whidbey Island alone.  Now, about 3% of prairies in Western Washington, and only 1% of Whidbey Island prairies, remain.  The spread of Euro-American agriculture practices and development expansion has led to the rapid disappearance of prairies and the isolation or extinction of many prairie species.   \n\nPacific Rim Institute is located on the edge of Ebey’s Landing National Historical Reserve.  The land is well-draining, gently sloping, and located in a rain shadow with less rain and summer heat than other locations.  These conditions made ideal fields, and it was only by luck that four acres of prairie towards the eastern edge of the property was never converted to agricultural fields, grain fields, or pheasant runs before the State Game farm closed.  \n\nIn May of 1997, Steve Erickson, an environmentalist on Whidbey, discovered the prairie remnant and within 15 minutes counted 19 native plant species, and by the end of the summer he found 3 native species that he had not found anywhere else on Whidbey. In 1998, the Washington Fish and Wildlife Department announced their plan to sell the Game Farm.

Panthera works to protect wild cats and their habitats and support human communities around the globe by reducing human-wildlife conflict, finding practical solutions for human-wildlife conflict, building tolerance for wildlife more broadly, and fostering coexistence between wild cats and the people who live alongside them. We employ some of the world’s premier cat biologists, who guide our conservation interventions to aid both human communities and wild cats in eight geopolitical regions in the Americas, Africa, Middle East, and Asia. Our flagship cougar project (“Olympic Cougar Project”) is located on the Olympic Peninsula in western Washington, where we work to support both local communities and the fragile ecosystems of the Pacific Northwest. \n \nPanthera’s Puma Program is devoted to developing effective conservation strategies for cougars, also called pumas, mountain lions, and Florida panthers. Our puma strategy emphasizes five categories of work:  1) Protecting and enhancing connectivity among puma populations, to ensure their genetic diversity and health; 2) Understanding and improving social tolerance to improve human perceptions of pumas, from communities to countries, and to guide human behaviors to support conservation; 3) Strengthening policy to impact puma conservation at larger scales and enhance coexistence strategies both regionally and globally; 4) Capacity building, to invest in local communities, indigenous peoples, and the next generation of cat conservation practitioners to ensure our impact is sustainable beyond our own lifetimes. Capacity building also includes the development of tools that conservation practitioners can utilize to conserve pumas and other wild felids into the future; and 5) Rewilding, to support range expansion into regions where pumas were extirpated.\n\nSince 2018, we have worked with six of 13 local Tribes (Lower Elwha Klallam, Skokomish, Makah, Jamestown S’Klallam, Port Gamble S’Klallam, and the Quinault Indian Nation) to enhance wildlife connectivity between the lower Cascadia and Olympic Mountains in southwest Washington and to support healthy human-wildlife communities. Over the course of our work, however, we learned that most cougars are killed by the state wildlife agency following conflicts between cougars and backyard livestock in rural communities. Thus, with the completion of the connectivity work that supported the Southwest WA I-5 Wildlife Crossing Feasibility Study and the new Washington Habitat Connectivity Action Plan, we pivoted our work to test and identify best tools to reduce conflicts between cougars and local people.", "Request": 50000.0, "SupportType": "Project/Purpose", "Project_Name": "Olympic Cougar Project", "Project_Description": "Goals: \n1.\tReduce human-cougar conflict across Washington. \n2.\tStage 1 (this proposal): Identify cost-effective, scalable tools that reduce conflict\n3.\tPromote conservation interventions and policy for cougars developed in Washington among western US states. \n\nAmong the most rapidly developing parts of the USA is the Seattle-to-Portland artery following Interstate-5; this critical conservation landscape connects wild habitats in the Cascade Mountains to those in the Olympic Mountains on the Olympic Peninsula. This landscape supports 13 Tribal nations, a critical climate refuge for people and wildlife, and a rich cultural and biological heritage in salmon, elk, deer, wolves, mountain lions and timber. It is a landscape mosaic of private, state and federal lands, including the roadless Olympic National Park. It is also home to communities that recognize that healthy wildlife populations are reflective of healthy ecosystems that sustain healthy human populations.\n\nBy far the leading cause of death for Olympic cougars is lethal removal by state wildlife officials following conflicts with goats, sheep and alpacas in peoples’ backyards. It was this realization that made us reflect on our current work and pivot our interests to activities that support and encourage human-cougar coexistence.\n\nHere, we propose a gold standard experiment with a “crossover” design across 16 sites in Jefferson and Clallam Counties to determine the most effective fence structure that protects backyard livestock from cougar predation. One of four control-treatments will be randomly assigned to a given site at the start, and then we will shuffle the treatments to reassign them to the 16 sites every six months. This randomness ensures a non-biased assessment of effectiveness and is the strongest scientific design to test such interventions. \n\nWe have specifically chosen designs that are cost effective and easy to install, with the plan that they are easy to adopt as well. Once we determine the best fence designs, we will collaborate with the state wildlife agency on an educational campaign to promote the adoption of best practices across the region. Simultaneously, we have begun discussion with policy makers about the potential for a public fund to help working-class communities build defensive infrastructure to protect backyard livestock, as is already available to build infrastructure to mitigate elk conflict with hayfields.

We will determine the most effective and economical solution to prevent backyard livestock depredation and then share this methodology with the community to benefit people, their animals, and cougars. With best methods determined by the end of the experiment, we will scale up our impact by promoting coexistence strategies across the Olympic Peninsula (260,000 people). We will also share our results with the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife to inform policy that adopts and enforces coexistence strategies, as well as to support an educational campaign across Washington state (8 million people).

Daniel Cheney, was shot down and killed during the U.S.-Vietnam War in 1969. The organization was born out of an initial effort by Washington State residents and veterans to reconcile American and Vietnamese citizens. In 1995, a small group of volunteers travelled to Quảng Trị Province in Central Vietnam, joining together with their Vietnamese counterparts to clear bombs and unexploded ordnance (UXO) and to plant trees on safely cleared land. This partnership was the first time Vietnamese leaders permitted an international nongovernmental organization to engage in humanitarian demining work. This trip was the foundation of thirty years of addressing war legacy issues including citizen diplomacy efforts where people-to-people ties are fostered between both countries to promote peace and friendship in the aftermath of war. Today, PTVN continues to prioritize citizen diplomacy opportunities for the healing and reconciliation of veterans and their families from the Pacific Northwest and throughout the United States. \n\nFrom the small group that visited Vietnam in 1995, PTVN has grown to an organization of over 300 demining staff. PTVN’s deminers have cleared nearly 6,000 items of unexploded ordnance (about 16 pieces per day) from over 10 million square meters of land. Once land is cleared, PTVN supports locally led community projects to return the land to productive use. PTVN also provides explosive ordnance risk education to the children most at risk, which teaches them how to avoid accidents and what to do should they encounter unexploded ordnance. Additionally, direct assistance is provided to survivors who have been injured by unexploded ordnance through educational scholarships and other support. Veteran involvement has remained central to the organization’s mission, and PTVN continues to offer a pathway for veterans to connect with Vietnam in a meaningful way. In 2024 alone, PTVN organized 7 trips, hosted 77 citizen diplomats, and planted 927 trees.

For 30 years, PTVN has brought American citizens to Vietnam to deepen people-to-people ties and to date has supported over 1,300 Americans to travel to Vietnam. These delegations offer opportunities for intercultural and intergenerational learning in Vietnam – when American veterans, Vietnamese Americans, descendants of both, and other engaged citizens travel, learn, and reflect on their experiences together. Citizen diplomats learn about PTVN’s in-country efforts including humanitarian mine action, risk education, and post-clearance community development.  \n\nThe U.S.-Vietnam war formally ended 50 years ago. However, many veterans still grapple with the ongoing impacts of the war they experience in their own lives. In addition, federal support for the Department of Veteran Affairs continues to shift – and alternative pathways to healing and reconciliation for veterans continue to be needed. PTVN anticipates in the years ahead that the organization will hear more from this aging group of veterans who wish to return to Vietnam in their lifetime. \n\nPTVN’s goal is to continue to support these veterans in their healing process. Through this project, PTVN aims to support Vietnam-era veterans by providing them a meaningful way to return to Vietnam – and this project will provide support to veterans to travel on a CDT.

PTVN supports veterans seeking to return – and those that participate in a CDT experience often report that they find healing through planting trees, sharing meals, and exchanging stories with former adversaries. Each trip is as unique as veterans’ own experiences – and has a trip leader, thematic focus, and 3-part orientation to prepare participants (see supporting documents for a sample itinerary). Past veteran participants have expressed that these experiences allowed them to honor losses on all sides, visit areas where they were formerly stationed, witness how Vietnam has rebuilt after the war, and support communities still affected by war legacy. Often, veterans describe their CDT trips as life-changing and significant in addressing their own long-term trauma. \n\nA CDT includes tuition of $3,500, which covers all expenses while the traveler is in Vietnam. To ensure cost is not a barrier to participating in a CDT, PTVN offers a sliding scale payment option. Through this funding, PTVN hopes to grow the sliding scale fund and is seeking $17,500 to fund a minimum of 5 PNW-based Vietnam veterans to join upcoming CDTs.\n\nAfter a CDT, PTVN offers free opportunities for continued healing, learning, dialogue and connection through post-trip reunions and other cultural programs. By offering sustainable spaces for support, PTVN aims to improve the social determinants of health for senior veterans.

In 2007 there was a series of heartbreaking suicides among LGBTQ+ youth in Thurston County. Many had no access to LGBTQ+ information or support, lived with unaccepting families, or were not able to come out for fear of negative outcomes. PK was formed as a community response to this emergency, gathering LGBTQ+ youth together in a facilitated, confidential setting and providing access to lifesaving support. Now youth have a safe and confidential place to meet during school to gain support and community. \n\nLGBTQ+ youth are nearly five times more likely to attempt suicide than their heterosexual peers, and three times more likely to seriously consider it. The number is even higher for transgender youth. LGBTQ+ youth experience disproportionately high rates of homelessness, foster care, justice system involvement, discrimination, and harassment. 75% of transgender and gender expansive youth feel unsafe at school, and those who are able to persevere have significantly lower GPAs, are more likely to miss school out of concern for their safety, and are less likely to plan on continuing their education. Rather than focusing on their education, many students struggle just to come to school and be themselves - especially in rural areas. PK continues to be extremely necessary; especially as LGBTQ and transgender rights continue to be attacked. The LGBTQ+ youth we serve experience a lack of safety due to their identities. 89% of our students report witnessing derogatory LGBTQ+ slurs, and 28% report having been physically attacked for being perceived to be LGBTQ+. 94% report having experienced emotional/verbal abuse. Over 60% report having considered dropping out of school. Almost 70% of PK participants report having deliberately tried to hurt themselves, and almost 74% report having had suicidal ideations at some point. The vast majority of our students who report bullying or harassment due to being LGBTQ+ also report no follow-up by school personnel, which is evidence that the problem extends to the ability of educators to support LGBTQ+ students and the lack of inclusivity in school cultures.", "Request": 15000.0, "SupportType": "General Operating Support", "Project_Name": null, "Project_Description": null, "Funding_Impact": "PK brings 440+ LGBTQ+ and allied youth ages 12-18 together weekly in all 14 high schools and 1 middle school in Thurston County during lunchtime in a facilitated, confidential setting so vulnerable youth have a safe and confidential place to meet during school hours to gain support and community. We host lunchtime support groups in largely rural & small town schools, not only to mobilize resources for LGBTQ+ youth in those schools - but to help ensure that those students who are rejected or unable to come out to their families have a confidential, safe place to seek healing-centered support. For many rural youth, PK is the only place they are able to freely talk about their experiences and challenges as LGBTQ+ youth with peers and LGBTQ+ adults. In addition to our work directly with youth, we provide training and community education to increase awareness of gender & sexual prejudice and increase skills among educators and families to address instances of such prejudice. In the words of one school counselor: “LGBTQ+ identifying youth in our school have conveyed an overwhelming desire and enthusiasm to bring Pizza Klatch to our school. However, most are not out to their families for fear of familial rejection, or have been rejected by their parents when they have attempted to come out. If the parents were supportive, we wouldn’t need the group.”\n\nBy working directly with schools, barriers such as transportation, conflicting extracurricular activities, and suspicious guardians are removed, making support much more accessible. Building relationships with school staff is an important part of the way PK gathers information about school climate, coordinates effective promotion of support groups to the students in safe and confidential spaces on campus. Of PK students, 91% of students who had a past history of suicide attempts said they have not attempted suicide since attending Pizza Klatch. 74% said they feel safer at school as a result of attending Pizza Klatch. 68% of respondants said they practice safe sex more as a result of attending Pizza Klatch, 54% said they use alcohol or drugs less as a result of attending Pizza Klatch, and 70% said they self harm less as a result of attending PK. 67% said they think about suicide less as a result of participating in PK programs.", "Org_Budget": null, "Org_Budget_Upload": "https://wewocknerfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/ninja-forms/4/PK-Budget-FY24-25.pdf", "Project Budget": null, "Project_Budget": null, "Proj_Budget_Upload": "Pizza Klatch provides spaces where young queer and trans people, many of whom feel isolated in conservative, rural communities, can see each other and support each other. When youth are able to come together in community in a way where their identities are affirmed and celebrated rather than questioned, dismissed or defamed, they become empowered to advocate for themselves, their peers, and their communities. We see this reflected in our annual surveys in which the percentage of students who feel more comfortable calling out bullies and reporting abusive behavior on campus will increase after a year of attending klatch. We see ourselves as a part of a larger movement towards protection for LGBTQ+ people by providing LGBTQ+ youth with the tools to survive and thrive. \n\nOur work is rooted in community power and the well-being of our community, and we are led by transgender, BIPOC, gender-nonconforming, queer staff & volunteers who share the experiences of our students, including having had experiences of homelessness, poverty, self-harm or harassment in school. In addition to our work directly with youth, we provide training and community education to increase awareness of gender & sexual prejudice and increase skills among educators and families to address instances of such prejudice. PK helps educate staff and leaders to examine the ways current policies and practices result in disparate outcomes for students who identify as LGBTQ+, particularly those who experience compounding factors of oppression (race, socioeconomic status, disability, etc). PK engages students, families, and community representatives as partners in dismantling systemic barriers, replacing them with policies and practices that ensure all students have access to the environments and support they need to succeed in our schools.\n\nAs federal funding changes and sanctioned discrimination against LGBTQ+ communities is on the rise, PK needs your support to support rural LGBTQ+ youth now more than ever!\n\n\n", "Recognition": "Pizza Klatch would recognize support from the Wockner Foundation at our annual event, on social media, and in our annual report.

By connecting, sharing experiences and learning together, parents overcome social isolation, gain confidence, reduce stress, and build stronger families. The PEPS experience increases family wellness and prepares families to cope with life stresses by creating social, thriving neighborhood-based parent groups.\n\nOur vision: One day, no parent will be alone. Families have the support they need and parents and children are connected, resilient, and thriving.\n\nWe serve families through both virtual and in-person groups. Last year, we supported over 3,500 parents through 300+ groups, including expectant parents, parents of newborns and teens, single parents, working parents, and LGBTQIA+ families.\n\nWhat we've accomplished:\n•\t40+ years of serving Pacific Northwest families\n•\tPrograms for parents at different stages, from pregnancy through the teen years\n•\tSliding scale fees and financial assistance so cost isn't a barrier\n•\tGroups offered in multiple languages and culturally responsive programming\n\nOur newest program: In 2022, we launched our Parents of Adolescents and Teens (PAT) program after extensive community research and a two-year pilot phase. We've now hosted 58 PAT groups serving 500 parents between 2022 and 2024, building on our expertise in peer support to address the unique challenges of the adolescent years.\n\nWhat parents tell us: Parents describe transformative experiences, sharing: &quot;I have more tools to improve our communication styles, I learned more science behind specific behaviors, and I heard from others in the same stage of parenting which was comforting and reaffirming.&quot; Many form lasting friendships that continue long after their group ends, creating ongoing support networks in their communities.\n\nWhy we're trusted: After 40 years, PEPS has become the place parents turn to when they need support. We have experienced staff, 14 trained PAT Group Leaders with expertise in adolescent development, and partnerships with organizations like Issaquah Schools Foundation, Lake Washington Schools Foundation, and University of Washington Forefront Suicide Prevention. We keep adapting our programs based on what families actually need, offering flexible options from 9-week comprehensive groups to 4-week focused topic programs, available in both English and Spanish.", "Request": 15000.0, "SupportType": "Project/Purpose", "Project_Name": "PEPS Parents of Adolescents and Teens Program Capacity Building", "Project_Description": "The Parents of Adolescents and Teens (PAT) program represents PEPS' direct response to a critical gap in family support services during one of parenting's most challenging phases. With the U.S. Surgeon General declaring a national mental health crisis among teens, parents are struggling to support their adolescents while managing their own stress and isolation. \n\nThe Project: This initiative will support three core areas: training and supporting our group facilitators with expertise in adolescent development, developing specialized programming for specific challenges like teen anxiety and communication barriers, and strengthening partnerships with community organizations to reach underserved families. We will enhance our bilingual capacity, create focused 4-week programs alongside our comprehensive 9-week offerings, and expand our successful affinity group model for military and international families.\n\nWhy This Matters to Our Mission: PEPS' mission is to connect parents to strengthen families and build community. The adolescent years test this mission like no other parenting phase. Research from Harvard Graduate School of Education shows that supporting parents' emotional health is key to preventing teen mental health problems, calling for &quot;broader efforts by organizations including schools and community groups&quot; to support parents. PAT directly fulfills this call.\n\nOur vision states that &quot;one day, no parent will be alone.&quot; Currently, parents of teens often feel more isolated than ever as traditional support systems fade. PAT creates the peer connections and evidence-based tools parents need during this critical window. Since launching in 2022, we've served 500 parents through 58 groups, with participants rating satisfaction at 8.25 out of 10 and 94% recommending the program to others.\n\nPrevention at Its Core: PAT is fundamentally a prevention program using the Strengthening Families Framework. By building parental resilience, social connections, and parenting knowledge before crisis hits, we prevent problems rather than react to them. When parents understand adolescent brain development and have peer support, they're better equipped to help their teens navigate anxiety, identity development, and social pressures.\n\nThis project strengthens our ability to reach families during the declared teen mental health crisis, ensuring that no parent faces the challenges of raising adolescents alone. It's an investment in community resilience - stronger parents create healthier teens and more connected families.", "Funding_Impact": "This $15,000 will help us strengthen our Parents of Adolescents and Teens (PAT) Program capacity to serve more families during a critical time when parents need support navigating the complex adolescent years.\n\nWho we'll serve:\n•\tParents and caregivers of teens (ages 10-19) each year\n•\tFamilies from all backgrounds across King and Snohomish Counties, including those we're reaching through partnerships with organizations like Mercy Housing, Africans on the Eastside, and Sistema Escolar\n•\tParents dealing with teen anxiety, depression, academic pressures, and identity development challenges\n\nWhat we'll do with the money:\n•\tTrain and support Group Facilitators (we currently have 14)\n•\tOffer flexible program options: 9-week comprehensive groups, 4-week focused topic programs, specialized affinity groups, and thematic workshops\n•\tStrengthen our bilingual outreach to reach more Spanish-speaking families\n•\tSupport partnerships with schools and community organizations\n\nWhat parents will get: Parents participate in either 4-week or 9-week peer support groups that meet weekly for 2 hours, facilitated by trained group leaders with expertise in adolescent development. Each session includes time for sharing parenting highs and lows, evidence-based education on topics like adolescent brain development and communication strategies, group discussions where parents learn from each other, and practical activities to apply new skills. Using the Strengthening Families Framework, parents build resilience, social connections, and knowledge while connecting with other parents facing similar challenges.\n\nWhy this matters: PAT is fundamentally a prevention program that strengthens families before problems escalate. When we build parental resilience and knowledge during the adolescent years, we create stronger foundations for teens to thrive. Parents consistently tell us: &quot;Learning alongside other parents increased my skills and confidence&quot; and &quot;I've been searching for a resource like this for years.&quot;\n\nThe bigger picture: Since 2022, we've hosted 58 PAT groups serving 500 parents, creating ripple effects throughout our community. The group leaders we train become ongoing resources, participating families often support other parents informally, and when families are stronger, schools and community organizations see the benefits too.\n\nThis funding will help us serve families during the vulnerable adolescent transition, ensuring parents have the tools and community support they need to help their teens navigate this critical developmental period successfully.", "Org_Budget": 2389671.0, "Org_Budget_Upload": "https://wewocknerfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/ninja-forms/4/PEPS-2025-Organizational-Budget.pdf", "Project Budget": 317492.0, "Project_Budget": "https://wewocknerfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/ninja-forms/4/2025-PAT-Project-Budget.pdf", "Proj_Budget_Upload": "Strategic Partnerships Drive Community Impact\nPEPS doesn't work in isolation - we've built a network of nine strategic community partnerships that amplify our reach and ensure we're serving families who need support most. We partner with organizations like Mercy Housing to reach low-income families, Sistema Escolar to serve Spanish-speaking communities, and Africans on the Eastside to support immigrant families. These aren't just referral relationships - we create tailored PAT groups designed specifically for each community's needs.\n\nMeeting Families Where They Are\nWe've learned that busy parents need flexible options. Beyond our comprehensive 9-week groups, we offer 4-week focused programs on specific challenges like middle school transitions or teen anxiety. We host community workshops for parents not ready for ongoing groups. We've piloted specialized affinity groups for military families and international families. This isn't program expansion for its own sake - it's responding to what families tell us they need.\n\nEvidence of Community Trust and Expert Recognition\nSince launching in 2022, our growth has come through community partnerships rather than just marketing - schools, healthcare providers, and community organizations actively seek us out because they see the difference in families who participate. Dr. Laura Kastner from University of Washington calls PAT &quot;the program of my dreams&quot; and notes the troubling gap: we expect teens to develop social-emotional skills while providing little support for parents to model these same capabilities.\n\nBuilding Community Resilience\nPAT participants consistently report improved confidence and stronger family relationships. But perhaps more importantly, they become resources for other families in their communities. The 14 group leaders we've trained become ongoing community assets. Parents who participate often become informal supports for other families facing similar challenges.\n\nInnovation in Family Support\nWhat sets PAT apart is our evidence-based approach using the Strengthening Families Framework combined with genuine peer support. We're not just providing information - we're building lasting connections and skills that strengthen entire family systems. Our flexible programming model means we can respond quickly to emerging community needs while maintaining program quality.\n\nThis investment in PAT represents an investment in community resilience - stronger parents, healthier teens, and families equipped to weather the challenges of adolescence together.\n\nWe invite you to watch this video, featuring parents who participated in our PAT Program: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE6HlRG3wbE.", "Recognition": "PEPS will recognize the William E.

This includes special grief programs and services for children like Camp Erin Snohomish County (a weekend grief camp) and community/school grief support groups. In addition, we provide support for individuals through our Patient Assistance Program to help promote dignity, safety, comfort, and quality of life. This program can help pay for items that insurance does not cover or meet immediate needs which helps to provide a safety net for families struggling to make ends meet. It also preserves the dignity and comfort of the patient, who is already dealing with significant adversity due to their medical condition and lack of resources. This program is available to both our hospice and our home health patients. For patients to access the program, all requests for funding must be made by the social worker or clinician who provide clear documentation that they have exhausted all other possible avenues of support, including insurance coverage and that the patient cannot afford to pay on their own. Patient Assistance requests made can be for medical supplies, minor repairs of medical equipment, food, utilities, housing, and other items that relate to the medical care of the patient or help ensure their overall safety and quality of life.

Established in 1983 in response to persistent racial disparities in education, we have grown from a traditional scholarship program into a comprehensive, culturally responsive college and career access organization. \n\nWe serve youth ages 16–26 with long-term, wraparound support to help them access and complete postsecondary education or apprenticeship programs and transition into living-wage careers through our two core programs: \n• Legacy serves high school juniors through postsecondary graduation, providing college readiness workshops, 1:1 mentorship, scholarships, career-connected learning, and a senior year paid internship. \n• Pathways supports young adults ages 18–26 with trades exploration, pre-apprenticeships, skill-building, and hands-on work experience. \n\nOur approach addresses barriers that often derail postsecondary success, such as housing instability, food insecurity, lack of transportation, mental health needs, or technology access. Support we provide most often includes laptops, bus passes, work tools, and academic remediation. Each student is matched with a staff navigator who proactively coordinates services and offers individualized support throughout their postsecondary program completion – ensuring they stay on track and graduate into living wage careers. \n\nDefining features of our programs and approach are our deep community roots, long-term engagement with each young person, and our dual-track focus on both traditional academic and trades-based paths. We prioritize flexible strategies to meet youth where they are and guide them toward meaningful, sustainable careers. \n\nIn recent years, Palmer Scholars has deepened our commitment to environmental conservation and sustainability. We share the William E. Wockner Foundation’s goal of addressing environmental and economic challenges by preparing youth for careers in the green economy. In 2023, we launched our Green Sustainable Infrastructure (GSI) program to train young people in careers addressing climate adaptation. Developed in collaboration with local municipalities and environmental employers, our program offers hands-on learning in areas such as stormwater management, solar panel installation, and green roofing. \n\nThe GSI program is a direct response to the dual needs of workforce development and environmental stewardship. It aims to: \n• Train a local workforce to support regional environmental resilience; \n• Create access for BIPOC youth to enter and lead in green industries; \n• Support sustainable urban development through education; \n• Equip communities most impacted by climate change to shape climate solutions. \n\nBy aligning economic opportunity with environmental stewardship, Palmer Scholars is building a more just, inclusive, and sustainable future in our", "Request": 25000.0, "SupportType": "General Operating Support", "Project_Name": null, "Project_Description": null, "Funding_Impact": "The need in our region is urgent. As of 2022, nearly 12,000 youth aged 16–24 in Pierce County were neither in school nor employed (WorkForce Central). Educational attainment gaps further reveal stark inequities: only 17% of residents of color over age 25 in Pierce County hold a bachelor’s degree, compared to 26% of their white peers (American Community Survey). Postsecondary enrollment rates reflect similar disparities in Tacoma schools—just 21% of Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander students, 34% of American Indian or Alaska Native students, 40% of Hispanic/Latino students, and 43% of Black/African American students pursue higher education, compared to 51% of white students.\n\nEnrollment is just the beginning. Completion rates remain troubling: 62% of Tacoma students who enroll in postsecondary education do not graduate within eight years. First-generation students are four times more likely to drop out than peers with college-educated parents, and nationally, only 11% of low-income, first-generation students earn a degree within six years (Pell Institute). These outcomes are not due to a lack of talent or ambition, they are the result of systems not built for all to thrive. \n\nThis year with your support, we will serve 230 youth and young adults by providing resources, guidance, and mentorship while exposing them to all educational and career pathways. We give them the tools to choose the postsecondary program that best fits their strengths, whether that is a 2-year or 4-year degree, or an apprenticeship program. \n\nThe impact we strive for is: 1) to increase postsecondary completion rates for youth of color; 2) strengthen the regional workforce by preparing young adults for high-demand, living-wage careers; and 3) disrupt the cycle of intergenerational poverty through holistic, student-centered support.

Our program serves children aged 7-18 in Western Washington who have experienced severe emotional, physical, or verbal trauma and/or abuse. Most (85%) of our clients are adopted or in foster care. Many have ongoing issues with violent behavior at school or in the home, with alcohol and drug addiction, and with abuse or neglect.  In many cases, these individuals have contemplated and planned suicide. The majority of the clients supported by RRR have also been diagnosed with debilitating mental disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, attention deficit disorder, and all forms of attachment disorders.  \n\nTo support these exceptionally high-risk clients, RRR uses scientifically tested mental health therapies that are individualized – one client, one horse, and one therapist work together to develop skills such as cooperation, trust, building healthy boundaries, and responsibility. All of our professional therapists and facilitators are trained and certified in HEAL, Human Equine Alliances for Learning, which is internationally recognized as a premier model of Equine-Facilitated Psychotherapy and Learning.\n\nAll of our services are provided free of charge, and totally supported by the generous support of our community.

Over the last 14 years Raven Rock Ranch has developed a unique equine therapy program that pairs rescued horses with children and teens who have suffered trauma or abuse to aid in recovery from trauma. Our program is designed to address abuse past and present, and to prevent future trauma.\n\nEquine-Facilitated Psychotherapy and Learning (EFPL), has been shown to successfully treat those suffering from the effects of trauma, depression, anxiety, and many other mental health stressors. Although many forms of animal therapy have been shown to be successful, equine therapy is unique in that it works directly with the feelings and body-sensations that hold the memories of trauma.\n\nExplained in simple terms, the human response to trauma and danger is to fight it or run away from it. It often happens that the fight-or-flight response gets stuck in a cycle that can feel impossible to break out of. Raven Rock’s therapy can “flip” the outcome. The difference between our Equine Facilitated therapy and other treatment options is that we never trigger the fight-or-flight response. Instead, we rewrite neural pathways, giving the client the tools they need to talk about their challenges when and if they are ready. They do not have to ever talk about these trials to be restored to a strong mental state.\n\nWhen a child comes to RRR they are carefully matched with a horse and Facilitator, with whom they will work one-on-one throughout their therapy. The bond that is developed between the horse, youth, and Facilitator is the real beginning of mental and emotional healing. The horse is the bridge relationship that allows human-to-human relationships to form and flourish. The child can feel safe with a horse, because their past trauma is related to human relationships. \n\nRRR is the only no-cost Equine-Facilitated Therapy program in the entire Western Washington region. Although we continue to grow both in our programming and facilities, we have a huge number of children and families on our waiting list. Our goal is to continue our expansion with additional staff, therapists, and horses to serve all children and families in need.", "Org_Budget": 425000.0, "Org_Budget_Upload": "https://wewocknerfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/ninja-forms/4/2025-RRR-Budget.pdf", "Project Budget": null, "Project_Budget": null, "Proj_Budget_Upload": "Last year, RRR provided 2,000 hours and 1,200 sessions of free mental health services to over 300 youth and their families. During the pandemic, our work stepped up – our kids were coming more frequently during the week since they cannot go to school and cannot socialize anywhere while staying in quarantine. Even now, with life returning to relative normality, we are seeing a much higher demand for EFLP than pre-pandemic levels. At the same time, our ability to meet the needs of these families will be severely limited if we are unable to pay for the professional staffing required. This grant of $10,000 will support the annual costs of our program. The annual therapy cost for each client is $17,000 (includes the horse). \n\nWe are raising money to support the tuition of 25 students, all of which have a high propensity to walk through one of three or all doors: homelessness, incarceration, and/or suicide. We have documented positive results in all evaluation metrics. 100% of the youth who dedicate their time to participate in our program show improvement. After 1 year of treatment, we typically see the following results:\n•\tSuicidal ideation rate decreases from 98% to 2%\n•\tGrade point average increase go from 1.7 to 3.2\n•\tSchool attendance increase from 58% to 93%\n•\tHome and school behaviors improve until the negative behaviors are extinguished\n\nRRR exists to help youth in crisis like Irene (not her real name), who has been coming to the ranch for a few years. Her trauma was the result of being raped at a camp she attended when 9 years old. She confided in her mom about the abuse years after the incident, and it left Irene feeling damaged, dirty, and unable to defend herself. Schoolwork suffered and she was suicidal. When she first came to RRR Irene was very quiet for at least a year, but she loved her horse, and every week she could feel his strength and courage and borrow it for a little while. Progress felt slow at times, but she stuck with it and made some hard choices about what was truly important to her in this life. Irene finished high school on time - a feat that no one believed she could accomplish.

Our mission is to fundamentally shift how the world addresses mental health, trauma, and suicide—especially among military families and first responders—by building the largest network of community-based support groups led by everyday people.\n\nREBOOT began in 2011 in a living room just outside Fort Campbell, Kentucky. A small group of veterans and spouses gathered, frustrated by the limits of traditional care and desperate for something that addressed the deeper wounds of trauma. What started around a kitchen table has now grown into a national movement. Today, REBOOT courses operate in over 40 states and have served more than 36,000 participants.\n\nOur programs are volunteer-led, trauma-informed, and deeply relational. Each 12-week course is guided by leaders with lived experience—often graduates themselves—who walk with others through a structured, faith-based curriculum. REBOOT removes common barriers by providing meals, childcare, and printed materials at no cost. Aftercare continues through our MyREBOOT platform, giving graduates tools to sustain long-term healing.\n\nIn 2025 alone, over 1,150 individuals graduated from a Military REBOOT course—the highest annual total in our history. That growth is due in large part to strong partnerships and consistent support in regions like the Pacific Northwest, where demand continues to rise.\n\nWe’ve also become one of the most widely published organizations in the peer-led space, with research featured in seven academic journals. But the most compelling outcomes come from the people themselves. Veterans who once saw no path forward are now reconnecting with their families, finding renewed purpose, and becoming leaders in their communities.\n\nAt REBOOT, we believe trauma may be part of the story, but it doesn’t have to be the end.

Grief impacts every aspect of life—emotional wellbeing, relationships, work, and identity—yet it remains heavily stigmatized and rarely addressed.\n\nWith the support of the Wockner Foundation, Return to Zero: HOPE has already made significant strides in 2025, working towards identifying current pregnancy and infant loss support resources in Snohomish County and surrounding communities. Through this landscape analysis and provider interviews, RTZ has identified a significant gap in training for birth doulas. To respond to this need, we are requesting $24,000 to develop a grief-informed, culturally responsive training and mentorship program for birth doulas in Washington State. Our goal is to develop the curriculum and launch in fall 2025.", "Request": 24000.0, "SupportType": "Project/Purpose", "Project_Name": "Doula Bereavement Mentorship Program", "Project_Description": "Return to Zero: HOPE proposes an innovative mentorship program to inform best practices for birth doulas and bereavement care. This will consist of one-on-one mentorship, a learning community, instructional materials, a resource directory, and evaluation and dissemination of impact. \n\nThe One-on-One Mentorship component will consist of monthly 60-minute consultations and real-time access to mentors through text and phone. This will help support birthworkers who are actively working with a client experiencing a loss when they need it most. This direct mentorship will be complemented by a robust learning community with other birth doulas for peer connection and shared experience, enhancing confidence and compassion.  The program also includes monthly 90-minute team meetings and continual access to a community platform. \n\nMentorship program participants will also have access to online perinatal bereavement courses, guidelines, protocols, and resources. We estimate participants will spend an additional 4-8 hours per month completing self-paced learning assignments. \n\nParticipants will also engage in resource identification to assist with the development of a statewide resource directory for perinatal bereavement resources in Washington State to ensure providers and families have access to additional supports in their communities.\n\nThis funding will also support ongoing evaluation of the mentorship program's impact on the birthworker community and feedback from families.  Evaluation findings will be used to refine the program and inform the development of sustainable models for broader implementation across the state and nationally. \n\nThe program will be led by Return to Zero: HOPE in collaboration with Christina Winterbourne of Intuitive Path Birth, a respected bereavement birthworker in Washington State. Together, they bring a combination of national reach, deep community trust, and specialized expertise in perinatal grief care. Christina brings over a decade of experience as a birth and postpartum doula, lactation specialist, and bereavement doula, informed by her own lived experience with pregnancy loss. Our vision for this mentorship program is to create a sustainable model of peer support that empowers doulas with confidence, resilience, and tools to care for themselves and others. Christina has already begun building strong relationships within the doula community in Washington and is committed to expanding access to culturally responsive, community-based grief education across rural and underserved regions. Together, RTZ and Christina will combine national expertise and grassroots leadership to create a sustainable, culturally responsive mentorship model grounded in trust, compassion, and community care.", "Funding_Impact": "This initiative addresses a critical yet often overlooked gap: most doulas receive little to no training on how to support families through miscarriage, stillbirth, or neonatal death, even though 1 in 4 pregnancies end in a loss and 80% of birthing parents go on to have a subsequent pregnancy. With Medicaid now extending postpartum coverage for up to 12 months, including cases of loss, there is an urgent need to equip doulas to provide compassionate, skilled bereavement care. \n\nWhile doulas are increasingly recognized as essential to equitable maternal health outcomes, most receive little to no training in pregnancy loss support, leaving them emotionally overwhelmed and professionally under-resourced. A 2023 Perinatal Loss & Doula Alliance report found that 67% of doulas felt unprepared to navigate grief and trauma in these situations. This burden is even greater for doulas of color, who often serve communities disproportionately affected by maternal and infant loss and who carry the emotional toll of navigating systemic racism alongside their clients. Over 70% of BIPOC doulas reported experiencing secondary trauma or burnout after supporting clients through loss without support.\n\n“We need more than just one training. We need space to process, ask questions, and learn together–especially as BIPOC doulas carrying this work and this grief every day.” Jasmin, member of the BIPOC Doula Collective\n\nRTZ proposes a mentorship program to respond to these needs through specialized training, peer mentorship, and a virtual learning community. \nDoulas will gain tools and receive support to help grieving families with empathy and confidence, while also learning to care for themselves. This initiative promotes sustainable, community-rooted birthwork grounded in healing and equity, helping birthworkers apply what they’ve learned in real-world situations. It provides a safe, reflective space for them to process the emotional and practical complexities that come with supporting grieving families.\n\nThrough this program, RTZ aims to train 20-30 birth doulas across the state of Washington, with a minimum of 40% identifying as BIPOC and/or serving rural communities, which are both disproportionately impacted by perinatal loss. \n\nAll participating birthworkers will be trained on culturally grounded grief practices and equipped with referral pathways to mental health and support services for families navigating pregnancy or infant loss. Through building this birthworker network, with targeted outreach, collaborative events, and partnerships, RTZ will raise awareness and expand access to grief-informed care, aiming to reach 500 community members and providers in the Pacific Northwest.", "Org_Budget": 324990.0, "Org_Budget_Upload": "https://wewocknerfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/ninja-forms/4/RTZ-Budget-2025.pdf", "Project Budget": 38000.0, "Project_Budget": null, "Proj_Budget_Upload": "We received our initial funding from the William E.

Rates of anxiety, depression, substance use, and suicide have risen sharply, with children and youth particularly affected.\n\nEvery family has lived through war, displacement, and violence. Many have lost family members or witnessed atrocities. These traumas impact not only emotionalwell-being but also concentration, school performance, and physical health. Stress-related conditions like high blood pressure, ulcers, and early-onset diabetes are now being reported among adolescents and teens linked to unprocessed trauma and chronic stress.\n\nTo respond to this crisis, in 2024 three ROOTS Project members completed Professional and Advanced training with the Center for Mind-Body Medicine (CMBM), www.cmbm.org The CMBM model teaches powerful, accessible techniques such as meditation, guided imagery, breathing exercises, expressive drawing and writing, movement, and group support, to help rebalance the nervous system and release trauma held in the body.

We provide emergency shelter, twice-daily meals, specialized case management, hygiene and laundry facilities, non-emergent healthcare, substance use disorder therapy, life-development programming, healthcare and employment referrals, housing assistance, and other services for up to 45 nightly guests ages 18-25 at our facility in Seattle’s University District. Our mission is to partner with young adults on their journey to stability.\n\nROOTS made a profound impact last year, providing some 13,000 bed nights and 30,000 meals to 494 unique guests. Our service numbers have steadily increased over the past three years, as pandemic-era programs have ended and several key providers have been forced to scale back or eliminate programming due to funding challenges, including YouthCare, Friends of Youth, Passages, Home of Hope, Catalyst, and ISIS House. All together, our region has lost more than 50 emergency shelter and supportive housing beds in recent years. ROOTS now provides over one-third of the emergency shelter for young adults in the King County Regional Homelessness Authority's Housing Inventory Count, a share that is expected to grow as we expand capacity over the next two years. \n\nUnder the leadership of our new executive director appointed in May 2024, ROOTS has expanded and enhanced our case management program. The new model has greatly improved ROOTS’ ability to engage our clients, follow their progress, and celebrate their successful graduation from the program.

Located just two blocks from ROOTS, many overnight shelter guests transition to the UDYC during the day for food, activities, case management and support.\n\nRecognizing the huge gap the closure of the UDYC would leave in the continuum of care for young people experiencing homelessness, other service providers stepped up to fill the need. This has culminated in a formal partnership between the University District Doorway Project, Street Youth Ministries (SYM), ROOTS, Teen Feed, Ryther, and other community organizations to provide holistic, wraparound care. \n\nAs part of this partnership, ROOTS will provide on-site case management at the UDYC during the day, as well as lead partner training sessions focused on best practices in youth engagement, trauma-informed care, harm reduction, LGBTQIA+ affirming support, and other subjects. We are especially focused on supporting young adults who may need extra time to build rapport or who are juggling multiple barriers to stability. \n\nROOTS has made some important changes to strengthen our case management program in anticipation of these added responsibilities. We recently hired an additional case manager and adjusted caseloads to give staff more time and flexibility to meet guests where they are. One of our case managers also stepped into a new Program Manager role, which has allowed for stronger training, oversight, and support across the team. These updates are already making it easier for guests to connect with a case manager and receive more individualized attention. \n\nROOTS is steadily moving toward our goal of enrolling 35 percent of shelter guests in case management. During this reporting period, 116 out of 353 guests enrolled in services, which brings us to 32 percent. While just under our target, this reflects strong engagement from young adults who are navigating complex and urgent challenges. It also speaks to the consistent, hands-on work of our team to build trust and support guests beyond nightly shelter.\n\nThis project is important to our mission because effective case management is the bridge between emergency shelter and stable housing. Studies show that half of all unhoused adults report experiencing their first instance of homelessness before the age of 25. By providing immediate, targeted support for young people, we have a real opportunity to interrupt the pattern of chronic homelessness and prevent a potential lifetime of dependency.", "Funding_Impact": "To support this expansion of our case management program, ROOTS is requesting $31,970 from the William E.

In 1991, Jim Martinson, a member of the local Wounded Warrior Project and advocate for disabled sports, met with the Spina Bifida Association and introduced its members to track racing and adaptive field sports, followed by an adaptive swimming team.  In 1999, the youth Seattle Junior Sonics wheelchair basketball team was founded and expanded in the 2000s to include both an adult and women’s teams.  \n\nDuring the 2000s, to better serve the purpose of the organization, the name was changed to Seattle Adaptive Sports (SAS). In 2011, SAS expanded to include sled hockey, power soccer, and goalball. The mission of SAS is to enable people with physical disabilities to push beyond their limits and reach their full potential. SAS is a regional hub that connects athletes and the community with opportunities to compete, learn, and grow.  \n\nSince 2017, SAS has served over 150 unique individual athletes as young as 4 years to as old as 75, who have either a congenital or acquired physical disability. Most athletes live within King County in the Seattle area; however, some athletes travel more than 200 miles to participate in our adaptive programs. There has been a 60% year-over-year growth in our youth participant pool in recent years. SAS is a unique, essential resource to our region’s disabled community. We continue to explore opportunities to welcome more athletes and include additional adaptive sport experiences to maximize sports inclusion for individuals with disabilities.", "Request": 46500.0, "SupportType": "General Operating Support", "Project_Name": null, "Project_Description": null, "Funding_Impact": "Seattle Adaptive Sports (SAS) provides inclusive team-based recreational and competitive sports opportunities for youth with physical disabilities including wheelchair basketball, sled hockey, power soccer, and goal ball that foster physical activity, mentorship, and community connection. SAS believes that participation in adaptive sports builds confidence, leadership, and social engagement. Research and experience consistently show that youth with disabilities who engage in physical activity demonstrate improved function, quality of life, and community integration. However, these youth face significant barriers to participation, including limited access to affordable programs, adaptive equipment, transportation, and trained coaches. City-funded programs rarely meet the needs of youth with disabilities, further restricting opportunities for engagement.\n\nTo address these challenges, SAS offers regularly scheduled practices and introductory sessions throughout the year for new, emerging, and experienced athletes. Weekly practices are led by volunteer coaches and support staff, with new players welcome at any time. Quarterly “try-it” sessions provide additional opportunities for youth to explore adaptive sports. SAS partners with organizations such as Seattle Parks and Recreation, King County Parks, and Kraken Community Iceplex to ensure accessible public spaces and inclusive programming. Collaborations with Outdoors for All, The Here and Now Project, and Rainier Adaptive Sports help maximize outreach and share opportunities across the disability community. SAS also conducts presentations and events at schools and professional organizations to raise awareness and expand access.\n\nIf awarded, this funding will support the salary of a dedicated Operations Manager to oversee outreach, program execution and logistical support for practices and coaching staff. It will also help offset youth program costs, including van rentals, coaching stipends, and wheelchair parts and repairs. SAS is committed to minimizing financial barriers for families, ensuring that no youth is excluded due to cost.\n\nThe project will achieve the following outcomes:\n- Engage 50–80 youth with physical disabilities in practices, clinics, and competitions across Western Washington.\n- Increase access to adaptive equipment by purchasing sports chair parts and supporting wheelchair repairs.\n- Expand youth awareness and participation in adaptive sports through outreach, partnerships, and increased program capacity.\n- Ensure that 90% of youth athletes report physical, emotional, or social benefits from participation.\n\nWith this support, SAS will continue to build inclusive pathways for youth with disabilities to thrive through recreation and sport.\n\nPlease see the following website page and video that help describe the impact the funds would have on our youth athletes. \nhttps://www.seattleadaptivesports.org/youth-sports/\nhttps://www.youtube.com/shorts/cGzriwOO-5w", "Org_Budget": 222672.0, "Org_Budget_Upload": "https://wewocknerfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/ninja-forms/4/SAS-2025-Budget-1.pdf", "Project Budget": 46500.0, "Project_Budget": "https://wewocknerfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/ninja-forms/4/Wockner-SAS-Grant-Budget.pdf", "Proj_Budget_Upload": "Seattle Adaptive Sports is a community-led organization that brings together creative, broad-minded, and dynamic people who share a vision of supporting a community that values people of all abilities and offers everyone opportunities to maximize health and wellness.

What began with just 56 students has grown into a year-round continuum of in-school, after-school, and summer music education programs serving more than 7,000 students annually across 113 schools and 20 school campuses.\n\nOur core programs include:\n- JazzSprouts: A music fundamentals program for children ages 8 months to 5 years and their caregivers.\n- Academic-Year Ensembles: Beginner-to-advanced jazz classes for students in grades 4–12, including identity-affirming programs like the Femme Ellington Project.\n- Community Concerts and Performances: Free and low-cost public events that bring families and neighbors together to celebrate student achievements.\n\nTo eliminate financial barriers, JazzED offers a robust sliding-scale tuition model and provides free instruments, repairs, and music accessories to any student in need. In 2023–24, 73% of families received tuition assistance, and more than 180 instruments were loaned free of charge.\n\nJazzED students have gone on to perform at nationally recognized jazz festivals in New York City, Nevada, and Georgia. Many alumni return as teaching artists or mentors, reinforcing our model of long-term impact and community investment.", "Request": 35000.0, "SupportType": "General Operating Support", "Project_Name": null, "Project_Description": null, "Funding_Impact": "A $35,000 grant from the William E. Wockner Foundation would have a timely and meaningful impact on Seattle JazzED’s ability to deliver equitable, high-quality music education to youth who have the least access and the most to gain. This funding would help sustain core operations during a period of financial transition, enabling us to preserve robust annual programming and meet growing demand for low- to no-cost offerings.\n\nBalancing financial stability with program accessibility has been particularly challenging amidst significant public funding cuts and the continued recovery from post-COVID enrollment shifts. Our pay-what-you-can tuition model ensures access for all students, but sustaining it long-term requires a more strategic and diversified funding approach. We anticipate a loss of nearly $35,000 this year due to reductions in public grant funds. Because of this, philanthropic partnerships, like ours with the William E. Wockner Foundation, are essential to our continued ability to serve students equitably.\n\nJazzED’s programs are often the only opportunity students have to access consistent, skill-building music education. Without support, many would be left out due to cost, lack of instruments, or schools without music programs. A grant from the William E. Wockner Foundation would help us remove those barriers, enabling over 800 students (primarily youth of color and those from low-income households) to participate fully, regardless of financial means.\n\nThis funding would directly support core operating costs, including teaching artist compensation, outreach efforts, and the infrastructure that sustains our sliding scale tuition model, free instrument repair and loaner program, and free community concerts that celebrate student achievement.\n\nSupport from the William E.

Each year more than 20,000 individuals benefit from Homage's core programs in food and nutrition, home repair, social services/mental health, and transportation. These programs help fulfill our guiding principles of independence, dignity, and quality of life.

Founded in 1977 by Dame Daphne Sheldrick, the SWT was created to build upon the conservation vision of her late husband, David Sheldrick, the founding warden of Tsavo East National Park, Kenya’s oldest and largest national park. The Tsavo ecosystem remains the base for much of the SWT’s operations. We are best known for our pioneering Orphans’ Project, a first-of-its-kind program to rescue, raise, and rewild orphaned elephants and rhinos. Underpinning this mission, are our extensive field projects, which protect wildlife and preserve critical habitats across Kenya.

These elephants are currently on their journey to be rehabilitated back into the wild. During 2025 so far, the SWT has successfully rescued 6 baby elephants, who all survived the trauma and injuries of their orphaning. All orphaned wild animals are rescued with the ultimate aim of reintegration back into the wild. To facilitate this next step in an orphans’ journey, the SWT undertakes “graduations”, translocating elephants to one of three Reintegration Units based in the Tsavo Conservation Area. The SWT’s Keepers and fleet of staff have undertaken 3 successful graduations this year so far, transporting a total of 9 elephant orphans to Tsavo East National Park. Every orphan elephant’s transition back into the wild is a delicate process ensuring that each orphan is given stability and a natural and nurturing environment, which meets their physical and psychological needs, allowing them to hone survival instincts and social skills over time. This can take up to 10 years ensuring the orphan can be accepted by the wild elephant community. The success of this is seen in the number of known calves born to wild-living orphans, which numbers 77 at the time of writing. These wild births demonstrate the tangible difference the Trust is making in sustaining and growing Kenya’s population of elephants. During 2025 so far, 6 wild born babies have been born to ex-orphans rescued and raised by the Trust.

These delays may include, but are not limited to, autism, hearing impairment, blindness, muscular dystrophy, cerebral palsy, and Down syndrome. SPARC offers services free, or at a low cost, throughout Skagit County. Additionally, our Children’s Therapy program serves children from neighboring counties. \n\nSPARC’s programs include: \n\nBirth to Three: Provides therapy and early intervention services for children aged 0-3 with significant delays in motor, cognitive, social, adaptive, or communication skills. Services are delivered in collaboration with the entire family in the child’s home by licensed therapists and early education specialists. \n\nPreschool Program: Offers formal education and therapy services to children aged 3-6. Each child with disabilities receives an Individual Education Plan (IEP), developed collaboratively with the family to establish personalized goals and objectives. Classrooms are led by certified special education teachers.  \n\nChildren’s Therapy: As one of 18 neurodevelopment centers in Washington State, SPARC provides therapy services for children, aged birth through 12, with neuromuscular and/or developmental disorders. Our services are in addition to the therapeutic support typically offered through Early Support for Infants and Toddlers (ESIT) or traditional K-12 school settings. \n\nParent to Parent: A family support program providing emotional support, informational resources, educational seminars, and social events to families whose children have special health or developmental needs. \n\nWe distinguish ourselves through strong community partnerships. We collaborate with early learning programs, such as Skagit/Island Head Start, to create inclusive classrooms where children of all developmental levels can learn together. Our partnerships with local universities facilitate practicum and internship opportunities for aspiring professionals in child development, therapy, and education. Additionally, SPARC leads the SCAP program, collaborating with healthcare facilities in Skagit and Whatcom Counties, local school districts, and other early learning programs to streamline the autism diagnosis process, reducing the timeline from several years to just a few months. \n\nOur mission is to build a foundation for lifelong success for every child, no matter their developmental ability. We strive to provide quality services to every child, by eliminating financial and language barriers. We are proud to provide services at low, or no cost to families, uniquely operate without waitlists while offering a variety of services within a single organization, and employ translators and bilingual staff throughout every program.", "Request": 20000.0, "SupportType": "General Operating Support", "Project_Name": null, "Project_Description": null, "Funding_Impact": "Untreated, developmental delays in children can lead to considerable risks of academic, social, and emotional setbacks. Research from organizations, including the CDC, demonstrate that children who receive high-quality early intervention therapies are less likely to require ongoing special education, therapy, or counseling services later in childhood and into adulthood. The National Library of Medicine has found that parents of children with special needs face unique stressors that differ from those experienced by parents of typically developing children. These caregivers may have higher stress levels, compromised mental health, increased symptoms of depression, and feelings of isolation, often exacerbated by financial strain and insufficient support while caring for their child (Smith and Grzywacz, 2014). The same study indicates that enhancing social support can lead to significantly improved mental health outcomes for these parents. \n\nThe waitlist for autism diagnoses and specialized therapies in Skagit County can be quite extensive, affecting hundreds of children and often lasting multiple years, depending on the facility. Despite the dedicated efforts of local healthcare providers to support the increasing number of children with disabilities in our community, this lengthy waitlist exacerbates the challenges faced by families and hinders children from receiving timely care and early intervention.\n\nOur approach minimizes waitlists, reduces financial and social stressors, and eliminates the need for families to travel to multiple offices/providers to specialized services.  Eligible children are able to access SPARC services immediately after birth, transition to our specialized preschool, and advance to Kindergarten through our collaboration with local school districts. Our parent support program aims to alleviate caregiver stress by providing free socialization opportunities, educational seminars, and resources specifically designed to support parents whose children have a disability.\n\nAnnually, SPARC serves 200-500 children and offers support to over 1,000 families across Skagit County. Nearly 80% of the families receiving SPARC services are classified as low income according to federal poverty guidelines, and 70% are from minority populations. We recognize that every child's journey is unique, so each child may receive services from one of our programs, or from several. Funding will help cover materials, therapy and health equipment, assessment tools, and general programming expenses for each of our programs including Birth to Three, Preschool, Children's Therapy, and Parent to Parent.

In 2014, a swell of grassroots momentum in and around Bellingham to repair some key systemic flaws in foster care led to the formation of Skookum Kids. Today with a $2M budget, employing 29 people and involving more than 150 volunteers, serving 8+ counties throughout Northwest Washington, it does three primary things:\n     Care for children new to foster care in an emergency shelter (called The Landing)\n     Train, license & support a network of foster homes\n     Facilitate safe, predictable parent/child visitation for families caught in the system\nToday, thanks to changes in state-level practice and policy that we championed, we see a growing need for services to identify at-risk families and prevent crises before they occur. In response, we created Skookum Family Partnership (SFP), an array of in-home supportive services that act as an alternative to child removal and placement. These alternative interventions keep families together and accommodate the unique needs of each family to help them thrive.\n\nSince our founding, almost 1,000 kids have spent at least one night at The Landing, and over 300 children have been thoughtfully placed in Skookum-licensed foster homes. In 2024 alone, 9 foster families were trained and newly licensed by Skookum; 42 kids were placed in Skookum homes; 22 children were reunified with their biological family or relatives; and 18 kids entered guardianship or adoption. We also supervised court-ordered parent-child visitation for 89 families, supporting parents as they rebuilt safe and healthy relationships with their children whilst working towards reunification. \n\nWe are also proud of our 87% reunification rate — meaning, 87% of children who have been placed into our care have been successfully reunified with their family of origin.

Skookum Kids aims to give every at-risk family the resources to build a better and brighter future for themselves, and we believe the involvement of whole communities is necessary to make that happen.\n\nWe serve over 800 clients each year. This is 800 children and families who have experienced hardships with extremely negative (and potentially traumatic) impacts. Funding from the William E Wockner Foundation is critical to help meet the growing needs of children and families by increasing our ability to meet the needs of our clients. This includes providing compassionate care for kids in our emergency shelter so social workers can efficiently determine next steps; licensing foster parents to offer dependable, nurturing homes for children in crisis; and supervising visitation to rebuild and reunify families. Our newest program, Skookum Family Partnership, is proactive in identifying the needs of at-risk families to develop solutions and prevent crises before they occur. Over the past year, Skookum Kids has received over 5x the referral volume for Skookum Family Partnership services than we are currently able to support.

We are open more days, provide more food, have more staff, and offer more services than other local programs, making our services critical for ensuring that vulnerable populations can access ample nutritious food year round. \n\nWe serve seniors, people with disabilities, the unhoused, low-wage earners, and others in emergency situations. Sixty percent of SKH’s guests are women, 20% are People of Color, most live in a rural area, and many are families with small children. All guests are low-income. 95% live in Port Orchard.\n\nOur guests rely on us as a stable and caring resource for addressing their food and emergency needs. Our core programs include: 1) a grocery store style food bank providing fresh, nutritious food and household goods 2) emergency financial assistance 3) help enrolling in programs like SNAP, and 4) resource referrals to community service partners. \n\nIn 2024, we distributed 1,097,629 pounds of food to 9,712 unduplicated guests through 28,597 points of service. We enrolled 55 households in SNAP and made 714 service referrals.

The primary languages spoken among clients include Spanish, Amharic, Cambodian, Somali, Arabic, Tigrinya, and Oromo, reflecting our commitment to linguistic and cultural responsiveness.\n\nSWYFS has a robust track record of accomplishments demonstrated by measurable outcomes. Recent evaluations highlight that participants in our New Futures After-School Program consistently achieve higher academic success, maintain GPAs averaging 3.0, and significantly outperform peers in school attendance and graduation rates. Our Family Advocacy initiatives have notably increased family stability and connection, with nearly 100% of families reporting improved access to resources and stronger community ties. We are trusted provider of multilingual, culturally sensitive counseling services, and in 2025, Seattle School District contracted SWYFS to provide virtual counseling services for all its schools.

It serves 250 youth in grades K-12. We provide this program on site at (or next door to) four low-income housing apartment complexes in the cities of Burien and SeaTac: Windsor Heights, Arbor Heights, Alcove at Seahurst, and Woodridge Park. \n\nOur New Futures Educators are college-educated, bilingual in English & Spanish, and skilled in classroom management, direct service work, and working with diverse youth. We offer 14 hours/week of tailored curriculum to each student. Homework help and tutoring is provided, but also a wide variety of non-traditional learning opportunities to pique curiosity, engage interest, build healthy hobbies, and make learning fun, such as classes in arts, coding, gardening, and cooking. \n\nWe work with middle and high schoolers on college and career prep, including resumes, job searches, mock interviews, researching universities, and understanding financial aid. We work with individuals and groups to build social-emotional skills like respect, empathy, and kindness, as well as to explore students’ cultural and other identities. We track student attendance at their schools, reaching out to families for further support if attendance declines and liaising with schools around academic, safety, or other issues the student is experiencing. \n\nMore than just an after-school program, New Futures integrates whole-family support by embedding bilingual Family Advocates at each site who provide access to services ranging from systems navigation (school registrations, online forms, etc.) to resource referrals (food banks, counseling, health care, translation services)—ensuring families are stabilized and empowered. Parents and caregivers receive personalized guidance and strategies to build at-home support and become active partners in their children’s education. The program’s location within housing complexes removes significant access barriers such as transportation and needs for childcare. \n\nTrauma-informed, culturally responsive, and linguistically appropriate, New Futures is wholly aligned with our mission, and its many partnerships are key to its success. We work closely with Highline Public School District to share data, lesson plans, and outcomes, assuring our work is connected and relevant. We contract with ArtsCorps and Geeking Out Kids of Color to provide high-level curricula in arts and STEM. We invite all residents at our sites to participate in our open houses and public celebrations (such as La Posada, a Mexican tradition featuring singing, processions, and food), building community-wide support for student success.", "Funding_Impact": "New Futures is responding to the severe needs of low-income, immigrant, and refugee youth Highline Public Schools (HPS). HPS, which serves 69% Low Income and 36% English Language Learners, is severely under-resourced, with 77% of its 46 schools rated below average in quality. HPS typically experiences poor academic achievement due to the many social determinants of health affecting its students, such as extreme poverty, housing insecurity, and poor health care. These issues are already difficult for US-born English speakers. The many immigrant and refugee families face even more daunting barriers, enduring trauma from war, family member incarcerations and deportations, and systemic oppression from racism, xenophobia, religious oppression, and more. \n\nThese families must navigate language issues, inability to access available resources (such as mental health, case management, rental assistance), and cultural shame/embarrassment in requesting for help. Being uprooted from their homelands also means the loss of family ties, community support, and cultural cohesion, resulting in isolation, stress, and mental/behavioral issues. As a result, their youth struggle academically, often have anxiety, depression, or PTSD, and drop-out rates are high.\n\nFoundation funding will allow us to continue serving 250 youth and their families across our four sites during the 2025-26 school year and summer of 2026. Almost all students served are BIPOC (97% - 99% per year), with more than half Hispanic/Latinx (50-62%). The most commonly spoken languages are Spanish, English, Amharic, Oromo, and Tigrinya. \n\nOur five-year impact report (2019-2024 - uploaded here) shows the incredible success of New Futures that your funding will support. The majority of New Futures students maintain a good GPA, avoid disciplinary incidents, attend school regularly and graduate on time. Only six suspensions were received among the 550 regularly attending students during these five years. On average, about 71% of enrolled students returned the following year, which is striking given their high mobility. Surveyed youth describe the program’s excellence, with comments like, “I love it here, and feel safe and at home,” and “Since starting the program, I have been more engaged in learning and more social with other people.” Surveyed families also show high approval, with 97 - 100% stating they would recommend New Futures, and reporting high satisfaction with the program, services, and staff.\n\nYour partnership will help sustain this proven program and ensure that the most vulnerable youth in South King County continue to receive the support, guidance, and opportunity they deserve.", "Org_Budget": 5640912.0, "Org_Budget_Upload": "https://wewocknerfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/ninja-forms/4/2025-Organizational-Budget-SWYFS.pdf", "Project Budget": 1012556.0, "Project_Budget": "https://wewocknerfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/ninja-forms/4/2025-New-Futures-Budget-SWYFS.pdf", "Proj_Budget_Upload": "New Futures does not charge for any of its services and is not an income-producing program.

Our goal is to promote health equity, as well as social and recreational opportunities for people of all ages with I/DD.  According to The Arc of King County, 36,000 people in our area have intellectual and developmental disabilities. Yet most of these people struggle to find recreational opportunities after they leave school because of lack of transportation, lack of cost, and lack of adaptable programming. Currently, most community members in King County with I/DD do not have access to recreational spaces and programs that are tailored to their needs. Those who can afford and get to a gym or recreational facility are often on their own as they learn about fitness and how to adapt a program to their needs. Even if the gym or center offers adaptive recreation, it can feel isolating to be the only person using accommodations. Our members have expressed a desire to exercise and play sports with (and against) others who have similar needs. \n\nSummit’s mission reflects the spirit of this grant in that we believe recreation is essential for physical, mental, and social well-being for all people, including those who have disabilities. The King County website notes that only 19% of young people in our community reach the goal of getting 60 minutes of physical activity per day, and this percentage is even lower for people who have I/DD (CDC, 2025). With the addition of the Summit Recreation Center, we want to ensure that every one of our members has the opportunity to meet the 60 minute per day goal, and our hope is that at least 75% of our members will actually meet this goal as shown through fitness center sign-in and class attendance data.

These families often carry the weight of military life—low pay, frequent relocations, and limited support networks—while raising young children, managing invisible wounds of war, and navigating complex systems.\n\nSTEP expanded to Washington State in response to the growing number of struggling military families stationed at Joint Base Lewis–McChord and other installations. Washington is home to over half a million Veterans and more than 60,000 active-duty personnel. Many of these families live paycheck to paycheck, vulnerable to financial shocks that can lead to eviction, food insecurity, or loss of utilities.\n\nSTEP's flagship Financial Wellness Counseling (FWC) Program is designed to intervene before short-term crises become long-term hardship. Through personalized one-on-one counseling and emergency financial support, we help families stabilize their immediate situation while equipping them with the skills, tools, and confidence to achieve long-term financial well-being. Counselors—many of whom are Veterans themselves—create realistic, strengths-based action plans tailored to each family’s goals and circumstances.\n\nSince launching in Washington, STEP has provided services to more than 1,300 military-connected families across Pierce, Thurston, King, and Kitsap counties. Approximately 70% of the families we serve identify as BIPOC, and all are low- to moderate-income households in the E1–E6 pay grades or recently discharged from service.

These funds cover everything from eviction prevention and utility reconnection to individualized coaching, budgeting, and crisis navigation—ensuring each household not only survives a current hardship but emerges stronger and more financially prepared for the future.\n\nFamilies served through STEP are among the lowest-paid in the armed forces, typically in pay grades E1–E6, and often face compounding stressors: high housing costs, gaps in support during military transitions, physical or invisible injuries, and the burden of supporting children on limited income. Nearly 70% of the families we serve identify as BIPOC, and all fall within low- to moderate-income thresholds.\n\nWith this funding, we will continue to serve families across Pierce, Thurston, King, and Kitsap counties, where need is especially acute due to high housing costs and large military populations. Each family served will receive intensive one-on-one counseling (averaging four sessions), personalized action plans, referrals to community resources, and—when appropriate—direct financial assistance to address urgent threats such as eviction, utility shutoff, or food insecurity.\n\nJust as importantly, STEP’s counselors work with each family to build long-term skills in financial planning, debt reduction, savings, and self-advocacy. This approach ensures that families gain not only temporary relief, but the tools and confidence to build lasting stability.\n\nSupport from this grant will allow STEP to sustain and scale its Washington-based operations, delivering measurable outcomes for military families who have served their country and now need their community to serve them in return.", "Org_Budget": 4048273.0, "Org_Budget_Upload": "https://wewocknerfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/ninja-forms/4/STEP-FY25-Board-Approved-Budget.pdf", "Project Budget": null, "Project_Budget": null, "Proj_Budget_Upload": "One of the most distinctive strengths of Support The Enlisted Project (STEP) is our team of Veteran social workers and accredited financial counselors. Many of our direct service staff have worn the uniform themselves—they’ve deployed, navigated pay issues, faced military housing shortages, and transitioned to civilian life. This lived experience allows them to engage with military and Veteran families with deep understanding, cultural competence, and trust. \n\nThis peer-to-peer connection is critical when working with a population that is often trained to endure hardship silently, mistrust civilian systems, and avoid asking for help. Our staff’s military background breaks down those barriers and facilitates meaningful, productive relationships that lead to lasting financial change. We believe this connection is a key reason why 92% of families we serve report increased financial confidence and stability after working with STEP.\n\nSTEP’s expansion into Washington was not incidental. We began serving families here in direct response to a request from senior military leadership, who had witnessed our results in California and saw a clear gap in services for junior enlisted families in the Pacific Northwest. Local command staff shared concerns about growing financial hardship, housing insecurity, and rising stress among their troops—particularly those with young families and no buffer for unexpected expenses. They asked us to bring our model north, and we did.\n\nSince that expansion, STEP has built strong partnerships with Washington-based military commands, Veteran service organizations, and local nonprofits. We’ve ensured that every dollar invested in our work here supports an infrastructure rooted in the needs of the region: culturally competent services, strategic outreach, and collaborative referrals. Our services are delivered virtually and confidentially, allowing families to access help without leaving their homes or interrupting work and childcare obligations.\n\nWe are proud to fill a critical and often overlooked role in Washington’s safety net for military families: bridging the gap between crisis and stability with dignity, empathy, and practical tools.

Many had seen combat, and all had lost friends and classmates in the process. These men that gathered in 2008 had a desire to remember and honor their friends. They determined the best possible tribute to those classmates was to ensure the well-being of their families and a memorial scholarship was created. Two years later, the West Point Class of 1998 Memorial Scholarship Fund, known more commonly as The 98 Fund, was founded. \n\nAs the years have progressed, members of the Class of 1998 saw the near continuous combat in which the nation and their classmates were engaged meant a need to expand The 98 Fund’s role. No longer simply focused on scholarships for the children of fallen classmates, The 98 Fund’s goals expanded to provide help to classmates who returned from combat different than the way they left, to create opportunities for the children to preserve the memories of their parent(s), and to remain ready to meet additional, un-foreseen needs that arise due to the dynamic and ever-changing battlefield of the 21st century.\n\nThe 98 Fund serves individuals, families and veterans from all around the country.

The original group included representatives from the City of Issaquah, Issaquah School District, Friends of Youth, Influence the Choice, and local businesses. The goal was to create a community space where teens could build social connections, emotional support, and access resources to build resiliency and agency. The Garage's concept developed through community engagement and in partnership with teens. The Garage's mission is to provide a safe, afterschool drop-in place where teens can gather with friends and access programming and services as needed. \n\nWhen we opened in 2018, the Garage filled a critical gap in services for teens in Eastside King County -- a place to connect and grow, free from the stressors that many teens face in school, at home or in other traditional, programmed spaces. Now, in our seventh year of operation, the Garage's service population has more than doubled since its inaugural year. We regularly see 60-90 teens accessing services in our space daily (five days per week, year round). Many of our teens are with us daily and rely on the Garage to provide safe space, teen-led programming, essential mental health support, and basic needs like food and clothing. \n\nThe Garage has become a cornerstone of the Eastside’s youth support system, widely recognized for our teen-centered model and embedded mental health support. We work closely with trusted partners – Eastside Fire & Rescue’s Mobile Integrated Healthcare response unit, The Circle, Issaquah Food Bank, Issaquah School District, and King County Youth Service Providers Coalition – to ensure teens can access a coordinated web of care. Over the past seven years, we’ve collaborated directly with teens to grow a space that reflects their needs and experiences. Together, we’ve expanded our services to include: \n-- Teen-led programs, leadership opportunities, and community events \n-- Daily access to food, drinks, clothing, hygiene, and sexual health supplies \n-- Onsite therapy and individualized case management—no intake, no appointments, no limits \n-- A trauma-informed culture of belonging, where connection to peers and trusted adults reduces isolation and builds resilience \n\nIn our June 2025 internal survey, 86% of teens reported that the Garage significantly contributes to their mental health and overall wellbeing.

Whether they come to decompress after school, meet with a mental health therapist, create art, or take the lead in organizing events, every teen is met with dignity, care, and opportunity. We serve all high-school-aged youth (ages 12–18), primarily within the Issaquah School District region – including Issaquah, Sammamish, and Renton. About 700 individual teens access the Garage each year. The majority identify with communities historically excluded or underserved, and those impacted by limited resources or mental/behavioral health challenges. Our June 2025 census data shows 46% of teens identify as part of the LGBTQIA2S+ community, 40% as BIPOC, and 40% as neurodiverse. \n\nTeens in our space are often experiencing overlapping challenges: economic instability, family dysfunction, identity-based marginalization, or anxiety and depression. Many have been negatively impacted by the very systems meant to support them. What they find at the Garage is not a program imposed on them, but a space shaped with them – one where their input, identities, and evolving needs are not only welcomed, but drive the work we do. \n\nWe remove barriers by offering all programs and services free of charge and centered around teen voice. Mental health supports are embedded in daily programming and provided by skilled professionals, with no complicated intakes, waitlists, or diagnosis required. Every staff member – whether a program coordinator, case manager, or development director – is trained to support teen mental health through trauma-informed practices, active listening, and relationship-based engagement. This integrated approach means that a teen doesn’t need to schedule a counseling session to be seen, heard, and supported. For many teens, the Garage is a fundamental experience of consistent, caring mental health support – woven seamlessly into a space that feels like their own. \n\nThis funding will help us maintain consistent staffing, teen-centered programming, and integrated mental health services.

We are one of the region’s leaders in animal adoption, education, and welfare.    \n\nSeattle Humane may be best known for our adoption services. Every year, thousands of pets are adopted from Seattle Humane. Pets stay at Seattle Humane until they find a home—no matter how long it takes. All pets in our care receive medical and behavioral treatment, if needed. Our team of stellar volunteers and staff ensure pets get the enrichment, exercise, and attention they need to thrive. Seattle Humane’s Lifesaver Rescue program transfers pets from other shelters (in WA and across the country) who do not have the space or resources to care for them, saving lives by prioritizing transfers from shelters who euthanize for space.  \n\nCosts of living are very high in the Greater Seattle Area, meaning one unexpected expense can force a family to choose between paying a bill or keeping their pet. Seattle Humane offers pet owner assistance services designed to keep pets with their people and out of shelters. For example, we operate a Pet Food Bank, which has already distributed 28,821 pounds of pet food since the start of our Fiscal Year (April 1st). Our Pet Owner Assistance Fund helps cover pet-related costs for pet parents experiencing financial strain, and our Supporting Pet Owners in Transition (SPOT) program provides temporary pet boarding for pet parents facing a crisis like unexpected hospitalization or domestic violence. We also offer free or reduced-cost veterinary care for pets from low-income homes, both on-campus and in community clinics. \n\nLastly, Seattle Humane cultivates the next generation of animal welfare advocates and veterinary professionals. Our shelter clinic is also a large-volume teaching hospital which provides hands-on training to about 80 veterinary students every year. Additionally, our Humane Education programming fosters empathy and curiosity in kids ages 3-18 through workshops, day camps, and our Humane Teens program. \n   \nThrough these programs and more, Seattle Humane promotes a kinder, better world for pets and people alike.", "Request": 25000.0, "SupportType": "General Operating Support", "Project_Name": null, "Project_Description": null, "Funding_Impact": "Seattle Humane’s positive impact in our region cannot be understated.

Our Community Medicine team completed 5,600 spays/neuters, administered 9,443 vaccines, and conducted 3,286 exams for pets of low-income people and families in need.   \n\nNotably, thousands of struggling people and families were assisted by Seattle Humane last fiscal year. In our 2024-2025 Fiscal Year, Seattle Humane’s Pet Food Bank distributed 209,465 pounds of pet food. 110 pet parents utilized Seattle Humane's SPOT program, and we helped 535 pet owners with pet-related costs—such as pet rent fees when they were forced to move, food, or veterinary care. The veterinary care Seattle Humane assisted with was often emergency and/or lifesaving. \n\nThis year, Seattle Humane will continue serving as many pets and pet parents as we can. Through our veterinary care team, we will improve the health of thousands of pets. The thousands of spay/neuter procedures Seattle Humane completes or subsidizes each year prevent overpopulation and strays in our community.

Our mission is to promote awareness of and stewardship for marine mammals and their habitat. Our overarching goal is to recover the endangered southern resident orcas from the threat of extinction. We accomplish our mission through our sites and signs, community outreach, and advocacy. \n\nBackground and History. The Whale Trail was founded in 2008 by Donna Sandstrom and a core team of partners including NOAA Fisheries, NMS, WDFW, Seattle Aquarium, and Whale Museum. Ocean Wise is our lead partner in Canada. Many members of the team first met when they worked together to return an orphaned orca, Springer, to her pod. The organization is headquartered in Seattle. \n\nScope and Reach. From 16 inaugural sites there are now more than 150, spanning the west coast from California to British Columbia. Each site has a page on our website, and many feature interpretive panels. The signs focus on marine mammals that might be seen at that location. We work closely with site hosts, biologists and community members to customize the signs. \n\nThe Whale Trail has created a new platform for ecotourism, and pioneered a way to watch marine wildlife without harming them. We have inspired and served as a model and mentors for similar efforts around the globe. \n\nSuccessful Advocacy.  Donna served on former Gov. Inslee’s Orca Recovery Task Force, where she championed solutions to reduce noise and disturbance, including a licensing program for commercial whale-watching. The recommendation became law in 2019, and was updated in 2023 based on best available science. All boaters are now required to stay 1000 yards away from southern resident orcas. \n\nA sea change is underway, against great odds. From recommendation to legislation to implementation, The Whale Trail played a leadership role in a public process that worked. Together we have made a tangible difference for J, K and L pods, by making it easier for them to find and catch their prey. And the whales show signs of responding. There are now 11 calves under 6 years old, and 7 of them are female. Their future is here!\n\nCommunity Engagement. The Whale Trail produces community programs including lectures, speaking tours, and stewardship trainings.

For example, extending The Whale Trail along the gray whale migration route in Mexico and Alaska. We will strengthen relationships with site hosts and partners, and create new ways for them to communicate better with us, and with each other. \n\nWe will make it easier for people to follow The Whale Trail, with an improved website, region-specific brochures, and a Whale Trail app. Our near-term goal is to reprint and distribute brochures on Washington State ferries and ferry terminals, coinciding with FIFA in summer 2026 (see attached for a brochure sample).\n\nAnd we’ll continue and expand our ability to provide shore-based interpretation. In 2026 we plan to  partner with marine naturalist associations to place more volunteers at Whale Trail locations.

EAPs permit ALS patients ineligible for more traditional treatment trials access to promising therapies that could slow their disease progression, but they are often underfunded by the drug companies that sponsor them, making it a challenge to implement. EAPs can generate data that can be useful, alongside traditional trial data, in providing evidence for efficacy and long-term safety and tolerability of experimental therapies and increase the potential to bring new therapies to market for all ALS patients.

Cohen Military Family Clinic at Valley Cities (Cohen Clinic) opened March 2019 in Lakewood, WA, in partnership with Cohen Veterans Network (CVN), a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization. In partnering with CVN, Valley Cities joined a national, clinically integrated system of mental health clinics located in high-need communities, delivering holistic evidence-based mental health care to post-9/11 veterans, active-duty service members, and military families. While the Cohen Clinic currently serves primarily Pierce County due to its proximity to and collaboration with JBLM, we have the ability to serve the entire state through our telehealth program. Since opening we have served more than 7,000 members of our military community with over 60,000 hours of essential clinical care.\n\nOur mission is to provide a high-quality, evidence-based, individually tailored, and holistic approach to outpatient mental health treatment for active-duty service members, veterans and their families regardless of combat experience, discharge status or ability to pay. A veteran is defined as any individual who has served in the Armed Services (including the National Guard and Reserves as well as current Active-Duty Servicemembers) in any capacity. The Cohen Clinic complements the care provided by the Veterans Administration (VA) and Military Treatment Facilities (MTF), and provides support for three specific underserved groups:  \nVeterans and servicemembers who do not receive mental health care in the VA or MTF, whether for reasons of limited accessibility or other factors (including personal preference).  \nVeterans who are ineligible for care in the VA system (e.g., due to discharge status, conditions that are not service connected).  \nVeteran and Active-Duty family members, including parents, siblings, spouses/significant others, children, and others living in the veteran’s household or significant in their life.  \n\nThe Cohen Clinic specializes in time-limited, evidence-based behavioral healthcare. We treat individuals and families who present with a variety of mental health issues including posttraumatic stress, depression, anxiety, sleep problems, substance abuse, grief and loss, transition and reintegration issues, relationship problems, family conflict, family stress, parenting issues, childhood adjustment issues, children’s behavioral or academic problems, and other challenges faced by our military community. The Cohen Clinic also helps connect veterans and their families with additional support such as housing programs, long-term care, and acute or emergency care, and other holistic needs through our case management program. \n\nWith more than 80% of our staff being military connected themselves, our mission is not just of professional importance but personal as well.", "Request": 25000.0, "SupportType": "Project/Purpose", "Project_Name": "The Steven A Cohen Military Family Clinic at Valley Cities", "Project_Description": "Central to our mission of helping all members of our military community thrive is having timely access with low to no barriers to care. This includes activities such as case management support, child watch onsite during therapy sessions, extended business hours, transportation support and financial assistance for people who may have co-pays they cannot afford or other insurance barriers. Due to the national shortage of mental health professionals, and even greater shortage of professionals with military cultural competency, we have also developed a developmental pathway for therapists interested in working with the military community to address this need and allow for timely access to care for those we serve. This includes offering a stipend internship while professionals are in school followed the opportunity to stay with our clinic as a full-time clinical fellow after graduation while they work towards licensure. While this program has been highly effective in attracting passionate providers, many whom are military connected themselves, to our work and retaining them long beyond licensure, there is a two-year period where clinical sessions provided by these staff cannot be billed to insurance. To support this program, we have had generous partners that have provided grant funding to support this work. This grant, if awarded, would provide support by covering the cost of care for veterans and their families who cannot otherwise afford care or are being seen by a clinical fellow who is not billable to their insurance. \n\nAlso core to our mission is suicide prevention, particularly within our military community. It is estimated that more than 130 people are affected by each loss to suicide. While we have clinical processes to support these efforts within our clinic, we recognize there is more we can do to leverage our expertise in this area. Our director and associate director are suicide prevention master trainers and subject matter experts. This expertise can be shared within our military community through outreach to providing education, training and safe storage devices to individuals and partners in our community that may not otherwise come into our clinic for care. This upstream prevention work has the potential to significantly impact our community well beyond the doors of our clinic and the individuals we serve.", "Funding_Impact": "The majority ($20,000) of this funding, if awarded, would directly impact members of our military community seeking mental healthcare. Specifically, this funding would support the care provided by our Clinical Fellows that cannot be billed to insurance and care provided to members of our military community who are uninsured or face other financial challenges in accessing care. This would be approximately 65-100 clinical sessions. This would allow us to continue to address the provider shortage in our area through opportunities for professionals working toward licensure, especially military-connected professionals, to become highly trained in evidence-based care through our training program and develop strong skills in military cultural competency. In turn, this ensures that those we serve receive care that is timely, highly effective and culturally competent which improves overall outcomes for that person, couple, and/or family. \n\nThe remaining portion of this funding ($5,000) would support the purchase of safe storage devices and provide suicide prevention education within our community. This includes purchasing at least 250 safe storage devices (trigger locks, lock boxes, cable locks) to provide at no charge for clients and members of our military community who may be experiencing thoughts of suicide or have a loved one experiencing thoughts of suicide. This would be paired with safety planning and education regarding the intent of the devices, which is to provide time and space between a suicidal thought and the means to end their life (ex. firearm, medication, etc.) which allows for intervention, using a safety plan and changing their mind thus saving lives. We have taken this approach to many outreach events which were very well received and prompted meaningful conversations around this important topic. Additionally, we have received requests for our team to provide training on safety planning to other community partners, mainly working with veterans in rural communities, so that there is a more comprehensive approach to their outreach efforts.

VFB began in the late 1970s as a small food pantry in the basement of the Presbyterian Church. A dedicated group of volunteers ran the food pantry, eventually applying for non-profit tax status in 1991. In 1985, operations moved to Sunrise Ridge, a former military property. \n\nIn 2008, VFB experienced a surge in clients during the recession, and in 2012, initiated an on-site garden. That year, we also  started the Home Delivery Program and expanded the hours of grocery pickup. Our Summer Meals Program for children and youth, Picnics in the Park, began in 2014 to address summer food insecurity. In 2018, we transitioned our main food bank space to a grocery store model, enabling customers to select the items they needed to care for their families with dignity. In 2020, we shifted operations to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic and designed an order and pickup model, and offered the summer meals as a to-go program. We have since evolved into a three-pronged model with in-person shopping, home delivery, and curbside pickup as options.  \n \nVashon Island is a geographically isolated island in unincorporated King County with a population of approximately 12,000 year-round residents and no municipal government. There are very few grocery store options overall on the island, and there is no affordable resource for food, such as a Dollar Tree or Grocery Outlet. VFB is the only food bank on Vashon Island, filling a critical gap in services. Lacking municipal support, Vashon’s informal network of social service agencies is left to fill the gaps and connect the dots for islanders who have multiple and overlapping social/human service needs.  \n\nThe mission of the Vashon Maury Community Food Bank (Vashon Food Bank or VFB) is to work in partnership with our community to increase our island's food security and connect people to supporting resources that help them thrive. \n\nVFB’s primary programs and offerings include: \n● Weekly free grocery service through in-person shopping, serving an average of 160 households each week. \n● Weekly free grocery home delivery, serving an average of 140 households each week. \n● Free summer meals for youth and families, serving an average of 204 meals each day and over 8,000 every summer. \n● The Community Resource Connections program provides referrals and assistance navigating local and government human services.", "Request": 15000.0, "SupportType": "General Operating Support", "Project_Name": null, "Project_Description": null, "Funding_Impact": "Support from the William E.

VFB has very low barriers to service and does not require customers to provide their complete contact information or proof of income, citizenship, or residency. Approximately 20% of households served by the Vashon Food Bank reside in Section 8 housing, and another 13% of the households served are Latinx families. Approximately 24% of VFB customers are seniors on a fixed income, with a majority of those seniors living in subsidized housing provided by Vashon Household (the only affordable housing agency on Vashon). \n\nVFB had the following results from calendar year 2024: \nUnique households receiving grocery services: 923 (a 10% increase over 2023) \nUnique individuals receiving grocery services: 1,829 \nTotal grocery services to individuals: 30,547 (a 17% increase over 2023) \nUnique individuals receiving summer meals: 787 \nTotal summer meals served: 7,573 \nTotal pounds of food distributed (both donated and purchased): 488,680 (a 15% increase over 2023) \n\nIn 2025, we have already seen a significant decline in the availability of free food from major distributors such as Food Lifeline and Northwest Harvest. These cuts are more devastating for our small community in comparison to larger metropolitan areas nearby. Historically, VFB has received approximately 10% of its free food donations from the Northwest Harvest partner network. In response to these cuts, VFB increased the amount of funds we spend on food purchases through increased wholesale purchasing. \n\nAt the same time, VFB has seen a more than 27% increase in demand for free groceries, which is significant for a small, island community accessible only by ferry. In light of drastic cuts to federal programs, like SNAP, Medicaid, and TEFAP, we expect the need for emergency food assistance from the Vashon Food Bank to increase significantly in the coming months. As soon as we received this news, we began looking at ways to make up the difference. While we have been increasing our fundraising strategies, it is challenging for organizations of any size to increase their fundraising by over 40% in just one year. Funding from the foundation would greatly support our ability to supplement donated non-perishable food items.

They created this unique new program to bring the powerful healing practices of wilderness Rites of Passage and Council Circles to all members of the veteran family. \n\nWe provide life-changing and life-saving programs for about 300 veterans and family members per year, most from Washington State and NW Oregon. Each year, we lead four 12-day wilderness Rite of Passage experiences specifically for veterans, several peer support groups per month including a Military Sexual Trauma recovery group, courses for transitioning service members, and other relaxing and social activities. Recent data collected from our participants showed that 100% had improvements in depression scores, 94% increased overall wellbeing, and 69% had increased social support (n=16, measured before and after our programs). \n\nOur unique model of veteran services is focused on guiding veterans to restore their Whole Identity (health of body, mind, heart, soul, and relationships), their sense of Meaning and Purpose in life, and their feeling of Belonging to a community that understands them and cares about them. We call this model “Identity, Purpose, and Belonging.” Our work is deep and holistic in nature, taking into account all the aspects of each individual and helping them reclaim the parts of themselves that had to be left behind in life or in military training (ie: their vulnerability, compassion for others, self-love, grief, or personal empowerment).

Home should be where we reconnect with loved ones and rest. However, home is only a dream for more than 1,000 families in the Puget Sound region. Instead, boys, girls, moms and dads are doubled up with other families on apartment sofas or floors. Many families are hidden. They’re sleeping in cars in parking lots or neighborhood streets, or even in tents. A period of homelessness can impact any family, whether it’s a teenage mom caring for a newborn … or a grandparent who is unexpectedly raising toddlers once again. Families in this crisis need support, care and real solutions to escape instability and danger. For 35 years, Vision House has served families experiencing homelessness in our area, believing that no one—especially a child—should have to sleep outside. In that time, we’ve created a proven strategy that works, and we continue expanding\nour impact today.\n\nVision House follows a mission to work with marginalized families who are experiencing homelessness – the hidden homeless in our community. Our program addresses the severe lack of safe and stable housing options by providing families with support and services to break the generational cycle of homelessness.\n\nOur transitional housing complexes, diversion centers and childcare centers are located throughout King County. Vision House helps to break down systemic barriers families face every day in trying to get back on their feet. We believe in a holistic approach that’s not just about housing. The programs Vision House provides for families are trauma-informed, strengths-based, and client-driven. We empower and equip each family member to find their voice, identify their strengths, develop their own goals and dreams, and work towards long-term stability in permanent housing. We provide opportunities for each family to experience life change and overcome trauma, generational poverty, food insecurity, legal issues, educational gaps, and situational homelessness. \n\nAccomplishments in 2024 include 36,317 nights of safety provided through transitional housing; 3,732 people served; and over 4,500 hours of service donated by community volunteers. In addition, 88% of families made the move from transitional to permanent housing.

We support each family as they design a plan for themselves where they can stand on their own feet and hold themselves accountable. We are client-centered: this is their work while our staff provides a community of friendship, support, love and grace and the chance to try and try again to recover and find stability. Our programs provide the opportunity for families to transform from the inside out. Core services include Family, Youth & Family Advocacy, Diversion, Early Childhood Education and Childcare, and behavioral health support for the families in our care. Our goals are to strengthen family relationships by looking at the issues between parents and children, acknowledging why it is happening and reinforcing relationships with the formation of trust and love. \n\nFunding would support the programs and services we provide to families experiencing homelessness. With their basic needs met, and program staff that walk alongside them, families in crisis have a greater chance to rebuild their lives and find success and stability. These needs include access to food, clothing, personal hygiene items, and blankets. Experiencing homelessness can make daily living extremely challenging. These families often find difficulty in accessing essential items and needs that most parents have no issue with. \n\nOur Diversion Center facilities are safe, welcoming places where we offer in-person assistance to help families early in their homeless crisis. The goal is to empower them to identify swift and practical solutions to accessing secure housing and creating stability. Annually, over 1,000 families reach out to Vision House through a phone call or email asking for help. When we hear from a family on the brink of homeless, we are quick to respond and follow up quickly and personally, ensuring they hear from an actual person who can help them instead of making them go through an endless hope-crushing series of automated phone menu options.\n\nOne of our key values is empowerment - equipping families to weather storms that come their way. We do this by helping them heal broken or strained relationships in their lives, including those with their children or extended families.

Formerly a camp for at-risk youth and youth with disabilities, in 1992 we began offering aid to the individuals and families who lost their jobs in the collapse of the timber industry. Because VOAWW is the only human services provider in the Sky Valley region east of Monroe, we have grown this campus, called “The Village,” to provide comprehensive wraparound services to the whole community.    \n\nPrograms onsite include the following:  \n\nThe programs currently onsite are: \n\nThe Sky Valley Community Resource Center (CRC) \n\nProvides wraparound supports for 979 low-income households serving 2,217 individuals total, including housing navigation, job assistance, transportation aid, and homelessness services. \n\nThe Sky Valley Center \n\nA multigenerational gathering place that offers 82 registered senior members and 305 other residents with lunches, classes and skill learning, social events and access to resources. \n\nThe Sultan Food Bank \n\nA vital food resource that distributes 424,000 pounds of food to 3,693 people every year.  \n\nSky Valley Early Learning \n\nLow-income families offered subsidized childcare (as low as $0/month) with state-of-the-art early learning curriculum along with family counseling and support. \n\nThe Sky Valley Youth Coalition and Sultan Prevention Coalition \n\nThese two youth programs provide afterschool programs that help connect youth to basic needs, socializing, homework assistance, and leadership and mentorship opportunities, and also works with community partners to prevent substance use and improve mental health among youth ages 13 to 18.  \n\nThe Sky Valley Haven \n\nThis two-story building will finish construction in September 2025. Designed as a drop-in resource center for youth, the Haven will host access to technology and digital literacy programs, a space for youth to socialize and hang out, homework help stations, access to the internet and technology, and access to basic needs including laundry, food and clothing. Once built, the Haven will host the expanding youth programs in the area.  \n\nThe Village represents everything VOAWW is trying to achieve: empowering people, strengthening communities and helping those in need find fulfillment and self-sufficiency.

Our mission is to provide homeless individuals with access to safe shelter, basic necessities, and the resources needed to transition to permanent housing and self-reliance.\n\nWWAH operates in Walla Walla County and serves a broader four-county region in southeastern Washington and northeastern Oregon. Our flagship initiative is the Shelter Community, the region’s only low-barrier shelter and the only facility that accepts couples, pets, and people with disabilities. The Shelter Community includes 47 hard-sided shelters, overflow sleeping areas, and a climate-controlled gathering room for meals, meetings, and social connection. WWAH serves breakfast and lunch daily and provides one dinner per week. Community volunteers provide dinner the other six nights. \nWWAH’s Client Services programs include our Exit Homelessness initiative, basic needs assistance, and mobile outreach. The Exit Homelessness program features on-site case management, goal-setting, and peer support. Our Peer Support Specialists use trauma-informed care to build trust, identify individualized goals, and connect clients with housing, employment, and services. In the last two years, this program has helped more than 96 individuals secure housing.\n\nWe also provide laundry services, access to mail, a mobile shower unit, and pet care in partnership with the Blue Mountain Humane Society. In addition, our mobile outreach team extends services to individuals living outdoors in order to meet people where they are and connect them to support.\n\nHomelessness in our region is exacerbated by a severe lack of affordable housing, extremely low vacancy rates, and systemic barriers to stability. According to the most recent point-in-time count, more than 200 individuals are experiencing homelessness in the region. This figure likely underrepresents the true scope of need, as it excludes those who are precariously housed or on the brink of losing housing. \n\nDespite these challenges, WWAH is making measurable progress.

With a trauma-informed, low-barrier model, we work to ensure that no one is turned away.\n\nThis year, our impact will grow, but so will our expenses. In response to increasing need, we recently expanded our Shelter Community by 10 new units. This represents a 20% increase in capacity as well as rising costs related to food purchases, case management, sanitation supplies, and increased staff time to manage day-to-day operations and support a growing resident population.\nAt the same time, we are navigating real challenges. Rising grocery prices and a reduction in federal food aid have both impacted the cost of food supplies.

Warm Beach was established with the mission to “Provide seniors with a vibrant, missional and purposeful lifestyle through every phase of their golden years” Since that faithful beginning, the Warm Beach Senior Community has been a place where seniors can discover their passion and live a purpose-filled life. Here, retirees form meaningful relationships in a community that supports their physical, emotional and spiritual health. \n\nA key part of the mission of Warm Beach is to be a financial safety net for low-income retirees and seniors. Currently over 50% of Manor Apartment residents are low-income and a higher number benefit from benevolent care through rent relief, Living Essentials and Medicaid Care programs. We have established the Good Samaritan fund that, through faithful giving and donations, is able to subsidize rent for our low-income residents. \n\nWarm Beach Senior Community now sits on over 100 acres in the serene landscape of North Snohomish County.

Nestled in the heart of Snohomish County and surrounded by towering evergreens, soaring eagles, and the tranquil Stanwood-Camano inlet, our campus offers a setting that nurtures peace, inspiration, and connection. This natural beauty deeply resonates with our residents, who include gardeners, writers, painters, missionaries, pastors, travelers, and individuals who share a profound appreciation for the outdoors and community life.\n\nOne of the most beloved spaces on campus is our ~80-foot atrium, a light-filled corridor that connects our assisted living center with the on-site restaurant and independent living apartments. This space serves as more than just a passageway—it is a hub of shared experience. Residents and their families gather here to talk, pray, reflect, and observe the changing seasons. Gardening clubs and exotic flower enthusiasts have transformed this area into a rotating display of life and color. From its wide windows, residents watch for the eagles that nest in the trees above, track the shifting colors of fall, and enjoy the warmth of sunlight in winter months without the bite of the cold.\n\nHowever, time and weather have taken their toll on the original windows. Replacing them is not merely a matter of maintenance; it is a meaningful investment in the ongoing vitality, comfort, and sustainability of our community. New, energy-efficient windows will reduce heating and cooling costs, improve safety, and enhance the beauty of this essential shared space. More importantly, they will preserve what makes this place so special: uninterrupted access to the nature that inspires and restores our residents.\n\nThis project aligns directly with our mission to provide a nurturing and life-enriching environment for seniors—a place where they can continue to grow, connect, and thrive. Replacing the atrium windows ensures that this cherished space remains both functional and beautiful for decades to come. It is a visible and practical expression of our commitment to stewardship, community well-being, and honoring the lives and stories of those who call Warm Beach home.", "Funding_Impact": "At the heart of Warm Beach Senior Community is a commitment to show God’s love through compassionate, dignified care for older adults—particularly those navigating aging and illness.

This is achieved through a vibrant culture of creative expression, learning, connection, and volunteerism.\n\nThese funds will directly support the renewal of vital shared spaces that foster creativity and connection: our central atrium and our community art studio. Every resident on campus—more than 350 individuals—moves through or interacts with these spaces regularly. They serve as hubs of activity, reflection, and inspiration. However, the windows in the atrium are aging, and the art studio lacks natural light and adaptability, limiting its potential as a creative outlet for many.\n\nWith this support, we anticipate upgrading the windows, soil, and plantings in our atrium and/or reimagining an underused outdoor space near our community center into a more functional, light-filled art studio. These improvements will bring new life into areas that have long served as places of beauty and healing.\n\nThe impact will be especially meaningful during the winter months, when many residents are unable to spend time outdoors. For those with mobility challenges or advanced care needs, having indoor access to natural light, warmth, and greenery is not only therapeutic—it is vital to well-being. Whether it’s watching birds in the trees through clear windows, painting in a sunlit studio, or simply pausing to rest in a bright, welcoming space, these moments spark joy and connection.\n\nIn enhancing these spaces, we also honor our residents' stories, talents, and faith. Many are lifelong artists, gardeners, missionaries, or teachers. By creating an environment that affirms their gifts and encourages continued exploration, we foster dignity, purpose, and spiritual fulfillment.\n\nThis project is more than a renovation—it is a reflection of our mission to provide not just housing, but a nurturing community where the spirit is nourished, creativity flourishes, and every resident feels seen, valued, and inspired.", "Org_Budget": 217113.0, "Org_Budget_Upload": "https://wewocknerfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/ninja-forms/4/WBSC-Board-Reporting-Budget-2025-1.xlsx", "Project Budget": 150000.0, "Project_Budget": "https://wewocknerfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/ninja-forms/4/atrium-glass-bid.pdf", "Proj_Budget_Upload": "There have been countless studies on the positive impact of an active lifestyle (I've attached a few relevant articles below) in older adults and health.

WCAAP is a trusted voice among parents, pediatricians, government agencies, and community organizations. Our work is rooted in science-based care, deep partnerships, and an unwavering commitment to the wellbeing of Washington’s youth. Highlighted are several of our many programs: \n\nFighting Vaccine Preventable Diseases: \nVaccine-preventable diseases are on the rise as vaccination rates fall due to misinformation and distrust of science. WCAAP works to reverse this trend by: \n• Promoting evidence-based communication strategies to help providers talk with vaccine-hesitant families. \n• Partnering with state agencies to ensure the viability of Washington’s universal vaccine purchase system. \n• Combating misinformation and working to reduce disparities in vaccine access. \n\nSecuring Healthcare for ALL: \nOne of the biggest challenges to child health comes from cuts to Medicaid, which provides healthcare for about 50% of children statewide. WCAAP is on the front lines, working to ensure that children maintain access to critical primary and specialty care by increasing Medicaid reimbursement. This allows pediatricians to break even when they care for Medicaid patients instead of losing money and therefore increasing the number of practices that will care for Medicaid patients. \n\nCommunity Health Workers – Navigating the Complex Healthcare System: \n\nWCAAP works with the Department of Health to ensure that paraprofessionals, Community Health Workers (CHW), are integrated into the pediatric primary care team, providing peer support and navigation assistance to families with social and economic challenges. By training CHWs and advocating for billing codes that can help pay for their services, we are involved in every step of the process of creating, educating, and maintaining this new workforce. \n\nExpanding Behavioral Health Access: Half of children with mental health disorders in Washington aren’t receiving needed treatment or counseling from a mental health professional.

This program increases vaccination rates by providing data and coaching for clinics.\n\nOver the past five years, WCAAP has served 64 clinics in 18 counties.  In 2024 alone, we coached clinics that served over 27,000 children and their missed vaccination opportunities decreased by 17%. \n\nWe work with clinics serving a large percentage of Medicaid, uninsured, and under-insured patients. Twenty four percent of the intervention patients were Hispanic and among those there was a 46% decrease in missed opportunities to vaccinate.  Twenty seven percent of  the families reported having low English proficiency or are not English speakers. \n\nAn equity focus is woven through the WACHIP’s structure. For example, a clinic working predominately with Native American patients created an immunization schedule poster that was reviewed to assure the content, and visuals would be culturally attuned to Native American patients. This intervention alone saw an incredible 37% improvement in vaccination rates. \n\nWACHIP is driving measurable, equity-centered improvements in child and adolescent health across Washington. We are not only increasing vaccination rates but addressing deep-rooted disparities and ALWAYS focusing on the most vulnerable population – children. From reducing missed vaccination opportunities among Hispanic youth by nearly half to helping Native-serving clinics implement culturally attuned interventions with dramatic impact, our work is grounded in data, equity, and community collaboration.

We bring innovative, effective, and collaborative approaches to the work. We’ve successfully urged decision makers to prioritize climate and biodiversity, particularly on Washington’s public state lands and community forests. Our education and engagement with leaders directly contributed to the state creating a grant program to support Community Forests from the Recreation and Conservation Office. \n\nIn recent years, we’ve driven over $120 million dollars from state climate investments toward mature forest conservation that supports rural communities. Working with partners, we successfully secured these investments each year—in 2023, 2024, and 2025—including through a challenging multi-billion-dollar state budget shortfall. \n\nThrough this project, Washington Conservation Action Education Fund intends to bolster the market for sustainable wood products and advance landscape conservation in the Nisqually Watershed. We are leading this landscape conservation partnership in close collaboration with the Nisqually Indian Tribe and the Nisqually Community Forest.\n\nOur organization works statewide across Washington state. We are prioritizing the Nisqually Watershed for this project because the area carries incredible ecological diversity and significance. The Nisqually River is fed by meltwater from five glaciers on Mount Rainier, with headwaters in the national park. It’s home to five native salmon species and several threatened and at-risk species. The watershed borders a wilderness area that is not actively managed, increasing the importance of ecological practices and active stewardship. \n\nMore broadly, the lowland forests in western Washington state represent some of the most valuable landscapes in the country for improving forest management given their potential to sequester carbon and provide essential ecosystem services such as water regulation and wildlife habitat.", "Request": 25000.0, "SupportType": "Project/Purpose", "Project_Name": "Advancing Forest Conservation and Tribal Stewardship in the Nisqually Watershed", "Project_Description": "Washington Conservation Action Education Fund works alongside the Nisqually Tribe and the Nisqually Community Forest and helps resource their ecological land management practices. Our goal is to connect conservation, Tribal engagement, and market change together into a cohesive strategy. We lead a partnership that supports the Nisqually Tribe and the Nisqually Community Forest in their stewardship practices that improve landscape conservation. The partnership provides financial support for forest practices that promote the sustainability and ecological health of the Nisqually Watershed region. \n\nOur existing partnership with the Nisqually Tribe and the Nisqually Community Forest allows us to play an ongoing, supportive role. Our network of relationships with sawmills, builders, and community members in the region enables us to support a local wood supply chain and landscape conservation. This effort will create a replicable regional case study for improving forestland conservation and bringing transparency into the wood supply chain. We will share the model with land managers and partners in other regions. \n\nOur long-term goals for this partnership include: \n1) Accelerating the transition to ecological land stewardship by incentivizing ecological practices and spurring other landowners to adopt this model \n2) Developing relationships across the wood supply chain to create a local, value-add market for sustainable wood \n\nIf awarded, support from the William E. Wockner Foundation would be matched with other funding, enabling our team to implement several deliverables during the two-year grant period: \n• Explore partnerships in the downstream of the supply chain: We will build relationships with the architecture, construction, and engineering community as well as owners and developers. Our efforts will strive to generate demand and recognition for wood originating from the Nisqually Community Forest and Nisqually Tribe. \n• Provide resources to landowners for ecological practices: We will defray the cost of ecological forest management by providing payments to the Nisqually Tribe and the Nisqually Community Forest for planning and implementing climate-smart forest practices. \n• Document lessons learned and create strategic communications: Our team will track the successful aspects of the partnership and lessons learned. We will highlight the project’s transferable strategies through compelling storytelling. \n\nExamples of ecological forestry practices we support could include: \n• Developing or expanding riparian buffers to better protect waterways \n• Wildfire risk management \n• Extending harvest rotations (letting trees grow for longer periods before harvest) \n• Retaining more trees after harvesting to better conserve the landscape and habitats", "Funding_Impact": "If awarded, support from the William E.

Combined, these efforts will demonstrate a new paradigm for forest management—local forests can support community-based economic development. When our work is successful, sustainable forestry and landscape conservation will be supported by thriving local markets for climate-smart wood products. \n\nThis project will serve forest managers at the Nisqually Tribe and Nisqually Community Forest, as well as developers and contractors interested in buying sustainable wood. Geographically, the project will support sustainable forestry practices on the 5,500-acre Nisqually Community Forest in Washington. \n\nThe work will indirectly benefit hundreds of thousands of people living in the Nisqually Watershed region, who will experience healthier local forests and more climate-resilient communities. Community forests provide inclusive access to green space for people in the area. Connections to nature improve mental and physical health.\n\nAlongside local restoration efforts, we work to recognize climate-smart forestry practices by connecting buyers to the sawmills sourcing wood from the Nisqually Community Forest. Through these efforts, we aim to ensure Tribal wood and climate-smart wood receive recognition, preferential pricing, and higher demand long after this project ends.\n\nAn investment from the William E.

While national parks receive their core funding from the federal government, this is not sufficient to address all the needs and challenges these parks face. This is why nonprofit philanthropic partners (“friends” groups) like WNPF are needed – to raise private support to augment federal resources, filling gaps by supporting unfunded and underfunded projects. \n\nFounded in 1993, WNPF brings together individual donors, corporations/small businesses, and foundations to collectively invest in addressing the parks’ needs. Each year, we partner with the leadership teams at the three parks to identify projects that require additional funding. All the projects we support must align with at least one of the following four Core Pillars: \n\n1) Advancing Science and Research — Protecting and ensuring the safety of precious native plants, animals, and aquatic vertebrates, understanding shrinking glaciers, and more. \n\n2) Improving Visitors’ Experiences — Creating learning opportunities for youth and families, funding trail work, signage, and search and rescue programs, and increasing engagement with park rangers. \n\n3) Expanding Volunteerism and Stewardship — Supporting responsible planning and management of park resources through a dedicated team of park volunteers and champions. \n\n4) Embracing Inclusion — Inspiring the next generation by creating opportunities for people of all backgrounds and abilities to access, experience, and learn to care for the parks. \n\nAnnually, we mobilize 1,700+ donors and funders to support 35-45 projects. Over the past three decades, we have provided more than $10 million to address park needs such as critical Search and Rescue equipment and training, trail maintenance, wildlife studies, conservation education programs, student field trips, ranger mental health support, bear safety programs, artist-in-residence programs, visitor safety, and youth internships. WNPF also works to build the pipeline of individuals who will lead the way in supporting and advocating for our parks for decades to come.

Wockner Foundation for Mount Rainier National Park’s Volunteer Programs. These programs will recruit, train, and engage 2,200+ volunteers in activities that enhance visitor safety and stewardship, maintain trails and meadows, and support public access to outdoor recreation.\n\nThe Volunteer Programs offer Puget Sound area residents hands-on opportunities to care for the park while enjoying and sharing its beauty. Volunteers work in each of the following four core programs:\n\n1) General Volunteers — Roughly 1,900 individuals will assist with trail and habitat restoration, invasive species removal, visitor education, campground hosting, greenhouse and curatorial work, and scientific data collection (e.g., amphibian counts, wildflower phenology, geology). Volunteers will also staff Visitor Centers and provide backcountry and Nordic patrols.\n\n2) Meadow Rovers — Some 300 trained volunteers will patrol subalpine meadows at Paradise and Sunrise—the park’s most heavily visited areas—educating visitors about the importance of staying on trails, respecting wildlife, and preparing for safe travel. This reduces environmental damage and lowers Search and Rescue calls. Rovers collectively log 13,000 hours and 200,000+ visitor contacts each year.\n\n3) Roadside Assistance Volunteers (RAVNs) — Six year-round RAVNs (two more than in 2024) will help stranded motorists with lockouts, dead batteries, low fuel, and minor medical issues. They also support traffic control and assist with Search and Rescue, easing the burden on rangers. RAVNs are vital to the success of the park’s newly implemented timed-entry system and are trained to address both emergencies and visitor questions.\n\n4) Alpine Garden Volunteers — The primary source of resource damage at Mount Rainier is people walking off-trail in subalpine areas. Dozens of volunteers will install and maintain seasonal rope and rebar fencing along 15+ miles of trail in sensitive meadow areas to discourage off-trail travel. Their work protects fragile alpine environments and includes trail monitoring and support for meadow restoration efforts at Paradise, Sunrise, and Tipsoo.\n\nVolunteers come from all backgrounds and are recruited year-round, with most activity occurring in summer. Roles range from short-term to season-long commitments and are open to all who apply online.\n\nWilliam E.

Welcoming more than 2 million annual visitors, the park is also a major driver of regional tourism, generating $70+ million in annual visitor spending to boost the economies of its gateway communities in the South Puget Sound region. Visitation to the park grew 85% from 2008 to 2021. This increased public accessibility, while terrific for sharing the unique physical, emotional, scientific, and spiritual benefits of outdoor exploration with more people, has unfortunately led to numerous recreational impacts that are scarring the landscape, disrupting complex ecosystems, and putting a strain on infrastructure and natural and cultural resources. Additionally, limited federal budgets and recent staffing cuts have created significant maintenance backlogs in the park, including repairing trails, roads, and facilities.\n\nCaring for the park’s natural vitality and ensuring its safety for visitors is critical, and the only way this work is possible on a public land mass as large and complex as Mount Rainier National Park is thanks to the ongoing contributions of time, energy, strength, and creative thinking of community volunteers. Collectively, 2,200+ volunteers contribute close to 79,000 hours of work to the park annually, which is valued at approximately $2.2 million in donated labor (equivalent to hiring 110 additional seasonal employees). Not only do volunteers get important work done that otherwise could not be accomplished, but many also become lifelong advocates for the park and its mission.\n\nDirect outcomes of the Volunteer Programs include:1) Better informed/prepared park visitors; 2) Safer park trails; 3) Increased protection of natural resources; 4) Increased capacity to engage with youth and families; 5) Faster emergency response time; 6) Fewer Search and Rescue incidents; 7) Increased roadside and parking lot safety; 8) Professional rangers freed up for more critical incidents.\n\nVolunteer Programs Manager Kevin Bacher oversees the collection of data on all volunteer activities.

WELD equips those who are reentering from legal-system-impact, homelessness, and substance use with clean and sober housing, employment opportunities, community engagement, and access to essential services focusing on recovery and successful reintegration back into community. We provide job training, career counseling, employment opportunities - and life skills, digital literacy, and healthy lifestyles classes in a supportive, peer-led community to decrease recidivism in King & Snohomish Counties. Since 2017, WELD has provided transitional housing to over 1,400 system-impacted individuals who would otherwise face a high risk of homelessness, recidivism, or relapse.

What they find is a peer-led, recovery-focused environment where personal accountability, life skill development, and compassionate guidance from staff lay the foundation for long-term transformation. Our housing model is transitional, with intended program time ranging from 3 months to 1 year. In 2019, WELD launched WELD Works, connecting justice-involved individuals to jobs in construction and labor. COVID-19 temporarily disrupted operations, but labor shortages reignited demand. WELD provided employers with skilled workers and participants with the income and structure needed to support recovery. As the economy stabilized, demand for temp-to-perm workers declined and it became clear participants needed more time to build life skills. In response, WELD sunset the temp-to-perm model and relaunched WELD Works as a direct-hire social enterprise providing trail maintenance, debris removal, and litter abatement. This approach offers steady employment tailored to reentry and recovery. In 2025, WELD also added behavioral health case management support to further bolster personal growth and stability.

Another 73,000 people are under community supervision, most commonly probation. All will face serious barriers to employment, as well as the stigma and prejudice that come with a criminal record. This shows up in the data: formerly incarcerated individuals are unemployed at a rate of over 27%—higher than the U.S. unemployment rate during any period in history, including the Great Depression.\n\nEmployment is just one of many barriers our members face. Currently, 90% of our participants are unhoused. Nearly half have been diagnosed with a mental illness, and 75% have struggled with addiction or alcoholism. These challenges are compounded by systemic inequities—Black Washingtonians, for instance, are incarcerated at a rate 5.7 times higher than their white counterparts. These complex issues require holistic, personalized solutions—delivered by people who understand firsthand because they’ve walked the same road. That’s the heart of WELD’s approach.\n\nLast year WELD housed 230 men and women. 80 left to live independently. We typically have between 110-120 people in beds on any given night.

Weld members who need healthcare resources often encounter a scarcity of available services due to a referral loop (where agencies refer individuals to other agencies), creating a cycle that hinders access. Some agencies only serve participants with specific issues, further limiting resource availability creating a gap in our ability to provide holistic support to our members. The ability to work closely with healthcare providers, clinics, and health insurance creating easier referral networks and access in a timely manner would lower repeated costly ER visits/admissions, increase preventive/primary care, and stabilize health conditions.\n\nAddressing healthcare access and outcomes disparities among our members impacted by the legal system and those in recovery requires peer navigation/case management from the moment they come through our door and throughout programming. Weld believes in building a strong case management program guided by our Clinical Manager and in conjunction with partners and local stakeholders with the project goal of increasing access to comprehensive healthcare services, reducing stigma, and promoting health equity for all Weld member populations.

Past projects include a youth-led soccer tournament where participants hosted a soccer workshop and led other neighborhood kids in a tournament to promote youth safety, and a flowers & letters to the elders project where students prepared single flowers during Valentine's Day, attached with hand-delivered messages. \n\nWe have designed an evaluation plan to measure our impact and adjust our practices based on the results and youth feedback. At the end of each 6-week session, we administer a satisfaction survey, which enables us to gather youth feedback on the program and receive suggestions for future programming. We also participate in an evidence-based quality improvement process focused on creating safe, supportive, engaging environments for youth. \n\nWith your support, we will help young people thrive and promote their overall well-being.", "Org_Budget": 577240.0, "Org_Budget_Upload": "https://wewocknerfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/ninja-forms/4/2025-Celebrating-Roots-Organization-Budget.pdf", "Project Budget": null, "Project_Budget": null, "Proj_Budget_Upload": "Since our founding, Celebrating Roots has successfully operated with funding primarily from government grants, enabling us to develop robust programs and serve our community effectively. However, as we look toward long-term sustainability and growth, we recognize the need to diversify our revenue streams. To reduce our reliance on a single funding source and ensure financial resilience, we are actively seeking support from private and corporate foundations to fill funding gaps and further strengthen our operations. \n\nWe have begun working with a grant writer to support our fundraising development goals, as well as a finance consultant to assist our Executive Director and board in refining our accounting and financial systems. We have a robust grants strategy and will pursue foundation and corporate grants this year as part of our primary organizational goal to establish a foundation for diversified revenue streams, ultimately leading to a more sustainable future.  \n\nAdditionally, over the last several years, Celebrating Roots’ board has been developing a sustainability plan to ensure the organization's longevity, both in terms of staff capacity and financial support. As part of this process, the board has prioritized decentralizing key organizational functions so that operations are not overly dependent on any single person, starting with the Executive Director. By creating robust systems and enhancing leadership capacity across the staff and board, we aim to establish a stronger foundation to sustain our essential work in the long term.\n\nWe also would like to note that Celebrating Roots, founded in 2014, was previously fiscally sponsored.

We opened Camp Seymour on Washington State’s Kitsap Peninsula in 1907 to provide camping experiences for youth. In 1910 we opened our first facility in downtown Tacoma. Since then, the YMCA of Pierce and Kitsap Counties has been a cornerstone of community service for over 140 years. Our mission is to put Christian principles into practice through programs that build healthy spirit, mind, and body for all. We are a nonprofit dedicated to empowering youth, improving community health, and advancing equity and belonging.\n\nOver the decades of solid community presence, our geographic service area has grown to include all of Pierce and Kitsap Counties. We now serve over 130,000 people annually through nine community centers, four early learning centers, two year-round outdoor camps, and dozens of school-based and partner-site programs. \n\nYouth development is central to our work. We serve over 50,000 children and teens annually through early learning, before- and after-school care, youth sports, arts, STEM, year-round camps, and teen leadership, and more. One standout accomplishment is the development and growth of our Community Learning Centers, which provide no-cost, high-impact academic and enrichment programs for at-risk middle school youth. Begun in 2012 in partnership with Tacoma School District and in direct response to a crisis of failing schools, the program has helped thousands of at-risk students to succeed. \n\nOur Outdoor Environmental Education programs reach thousands of students each year through Camp Seymour and Camp Lake Helena, where youth learn hands-on ecological stewardship, wildlife science, sustainability, and outdoor skills. Through these we nurture a generation of environmentally conscious leaders. In addition, many of our day camps and afterschool offerings incorporate environmental literacy, gardening, recycling, and nature-based activities that foster a deep connection to the natural world.\n\nEquity is woven throughout our mission. We provide over $2.5 million annually in financial aid and program subsidies to ensure accessibility for all. Our inclusion-focused policies and staff training ensure that every person feels seen, valued, and supported, regardless of age, beliefs, background, identity, or ability.\n\nOver the decades, the Y has continually evolved to meet the changing needs of our community—and our commitment to youth development, healthy living, and social responsibility remains unwavering. Today, we continue to innovate and expand our reach, helping young people grow into thriving, resilient adults while fostering a healthier, more sustainable world.", "Request": 50000.0, "SupportType": "Project/Purpose", "Project_Name": "Camp Seymour Living Machine Restoration", "Project_Description": "Installed in 2003, Camp Seymour’s Living Machine is an ecologically engineered wastewater treatment system that mimics the natural purification processes of wetlands. Designed as a closed-loop, greenhouse-housed installation, it is classified as a large onsite sewer system (LOSS) and treats up to 10,000 gallons of wastewater daily using a combination of natural and engineered processes—including hydroponic reactor tanks, constructed wetlands, textile trickling filters, and UV disinfection. It serves as the only sewage treatment system on site, supporting every operational building on the 160-acre property and over 250 people daily in peak months.\n\nNow over 20 years old, critical components of the system are failing. Most urgently, the textile trickling filters (AX100 units)—responsible for 85% of the wastewater’s biological pre-treatment—have deteriorated beyond repair. Blowers, sensors, flow meters, UV systems, and electrical controls have also failed or are unreliable. Without these elements functioning, the system cannot meet public health standards, placing Camp Seymour at imminent risk of shutdown. \n\nThis project will restore the Living Machine to full, safe, and efficient operation. The scope includes full replacement of textile filters, blower system, UV disinfection units, electrical controls, and degraded plumbing infrastructure. It will also improve monitoring through sensor upgrades and system integration, enabling proactive maintenance and environmental compliance. \n\nThis repair is essential to the YMCA’s mission and purpose at Camp Seymour of strengthening communities through youth development, healthy living, and social responsibility. The Living Machine represents environmental stewardship in action—a core value of YMCA programming. It is also a vital educational tool integrated into school curricula and camp experiences, teaching thousands of youth about water conservation, ecological systems, and human impact on the environment. \n\nBecause of the urgency of this need, we are on a fast track for this project. Critical preconstruction and planning milestones have been completed including full system assessment and technical evaluation. A detailed contractor scope of work / itemized quote has been accepted from Columbia Land Services and we have authorized them to order the replacement equipment. Work will comply with WA DOH LOSS standards (WAC 246‑272B), and is scheduled to begin in November 2025 and be completed by March 2026.", "Funding_Impact": "The Living Machine is Camp Seymour’s sole wastewater treatment system. Without this on-site solution, no sewage system exists to support camp operations. Its failure would trigger an automatic shutdown, closing the camp until all repairs are complete. This would abruptly suspend all youth programming, including summer overnight camp, outdoor education, and family retreats—displacing thousands of students, educators, and campers. A $50,000 grant toward the Living Machine restoration will allow us to continue providing year-round camp experiences and Outdoor Environmental Education (OEE) without interruption to 10,000 youth annually. The requested funds would be immediately applied to restoring the failed components, including filters, UV sterilizers, blowers, and sensor systems—components essential for operational safety and compliance.\n\nCamp Seymour’s OEE program typically serves over 130 schools in 10 school districts in diverse Washington communities from Vancouver to Aberdeen, and Thorp and Stanwood, with the majority of schools situated in the Puget Sound region. Students come from a mix of communities approximately 13% rural, 43% suburban/rural-urban, and 44% urban. Our participants are split equally between boys and girls, with our campers being about 13% Asian/Pacific Islander, 6% Black/African American, .5% East Indian, 8% Hispanic, 7% Multi-racial, .5% Other, and 51% White/Caucasian. \n\nAlthough Camp Seymour also supports teens with Wilderness Adventures, Leadership Training, and Counselor-in-Training and camp staff opportunities, the grades and ages that attend our OEE program include: 5% K-3rd grade (ages 5-9), 5% 4th grade (ages 9-10), 63% 5th graders (ages 11-12), 20% 6th graders (ages 12-13), and 7% 7th and 8th graders (ages 13-14). These students engage in immersive learning centered on sustainability, ecosystems, and environmental science—curricula that prominently feature the Living Machine as a hands-on teaching tool. Youth observe real-time ecological engineering as the system cleans wastewater using plants, microbes, and filtration. This visual, experiential learning helps youth grasp water scarcity, pollution, and climate resilience—concepts difficult to convey in a classroom alone. \n\nThese funds will also have a major environmental impact. The Living Machine removes nitrogen and phosphorus from wastewater, preventing nutrient pollution in Puget Sound. It reclaims and reuses water for on-site irrigation, reducing strain on local freshwater resources; and minimizing reliance on traditional septic systems that can leach pollutants into soil and groundwater. It also reduces the production of secondary biosolids and avoids chemical disinfectants, making it a cleaner, low-waste alternative for sensitive environmental areas.", "Org_Budget": 74093974.0, "Org_Budget_Upload": "https://wewocknerfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/ninja-forms/4/BUDGET-YMCA-2025-Organization-Budget.pdf", "Project Budget": 598273.0, "Project_Budget": "https://wewocknerfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/ninja-forms/4/YMCA-Living-Machine-BUDGET-and-Scope-of-Work-Quote.pdf", "Proj_Budget_Upload": "The Y’s many non-income-producing, free community services include camp scholarships, after-school programs, child care scholarships, youth violence prevention, and homeless hygiene services among many others.

The Y is wrapping up two major Capital Campaigns: A $30 million project to build a new Pearl St. YMCA facility in Tacoma, and a $7 million campaign to build new sports fields in the Gig Harbor area of Kitsap Peninsula (just five miles away from Camp Seymour). These are both years-long efforts that have maximized the generosity our community across two counties. \n\nAdditionally, the urgency of this project means that we do not have the luxury of applying for major funding from WA State Department of Ecology (with its one-year application and project approval timeline). Private foundation support, YMCA reserves, and loans are planned to fund this project. Although the Y is a large organization with a 2025 budget of $74 million, each facility, site, and indeed each program, is responsible for its own budget. Funding from William E. Wockner Foundation will reduce the burden of loan debt in 2026 and beyond for Camp Seymour, greatly enhancing its ability to focus its limited resources on programming, staffing, and scholarships for those in need.", "Recognition": "The Y will recognize William E. Wockner Foundation for this contribution in the following ways: \n\n  • The Foundation will be listed as a major donor to the Camp Seymour Living Machine Restoration on durable signage permanently installed either outside or inside the greenhouse. This sign will acknowledge all major donors to the project and will remain part of the facility for the life of the system—estimated to serve the camp and community for another 20+ years.\n\n  • The Foundation’s name and logo will be included in a short video documenting the Living Machine restoration, which will include footage of the project and interviews about its environmental and educational impact. This video will be promoted on our blog and hosted on our YouTube channel.\n\n  • The Foundation will be recognized in social media posts announcing the project’s funding milestones and completion. YMCA of Pierce and Kitsap Counties has a highly engaged community audience across multiple platforms, and the reach of these posts will highlight our gratitude along with the Foundation’s commitment to environmental sustainability and youth education.\n\nFinally, we are happy to discuss other recognition opportunities that the William E. Wockner Foundation may prefer, including invitations to attend the ribbon-cutting or tours of the restored facility. We understand that foundations may have unique visibility preferences, and we would be honored to tailor our recognition accordingly.

A nationwide YMCA program, Youth & Government (YAG) brings youth (ages 13-18) together to gain first-hand experience in civic engagement through Mock Trial and the Youth Legislative Session. The Y believes that introducing youth to civic activities and government processes will not only build confidence and leadership skills for participants, but will also create a more equitable, prosperous community for all by preparing Snohomish and Island County’s next generation of civic leaders to address local and global issues. \n\nYAG was developed to encourage youth to discuss current events and issues important to them and their community, then guide youth through the process of turning those discussions into action through debate, shaping bills, and taking policy positions. Youth and Government meets weekly and each spring culminates in the Youth Legislative Session in Olympia where participants have the opportunity to submit bills they have created to the Youth Senate for review and feedback and the chance to participate in Legislative, Judicial, and Executive roles or media and lobbyist positions. \n\nOne youth shared during this year’s Youth Leadership Banquet, “I had a lot of self-confidence issues and didn’t think I belonged in a place where people had so many opinions […] {YAG] truly can change your life, it can provide you with ways to see your future you hadn’t seen before.

Our mission is to eliminate racism, empower women, and strengthen communities.\nToday, we operate 24 locations across King and Snohomish Counties and serve over 9,300 people annually. From Everett to Auburn, we have built tremendous trust within the communities we serve. In 2024, 62% of our clients were adults and 37% were children under 18; 74% were low-income and 69% were experiencing homelessness at intake; and 33% had experienced domestic violence. \nOur work is grounded in three pillars of support: 1) Housing, 2) Economic Advancement, and 3) Health & Safety. Together, YWCA programs address both immediate needs and long-term structural barriers to form a continuum of care and support to individuals as they build stable, self-determined futures. \nYWCA has a longstanding presence in Snohomish County, including over three decades of housing and sheltering operations in Lynnwood at YWCA Pathways Homeward Bound and YWCA Project Reunite. Pathways is a 45-day emergency shelter for people with children where families have their own room and meet regularly with an advocate to develop and execute a Housing Stability Action Plan. Project Reunite provides 20 units of permanent supportive housing for parents experiencing homelessness while undergoing treatment for addiction. Families are supported through the dependency and reunification process and connected to housing vouchers upon program exit. \nYWCA also hosts the Parents for Parents (P4P) program for Snohomish County, part of a statewide initiative that promotes safe, timely reunification of families through early peer mentoring and education on the dependency system. Participating families receive basic needs assistance averaging $150 per month to help with gas, food, and baby supplies. \nTo build on the success of these programs, YWCA launched Homeward House Collaborative in 2019. Homeward House’s target population is pregnant and parenting individuals of any gender with children aged 0-8 with a primary focus on infants. These families are living below the Federal Poverty Level and are struggling with an opioid or other substance use disorder and have experienced or are at high risk of experiencing involvement with the child welfare system.

They provide safety, support, and healing for individuals and families experiencing homelessness, poverty, and trauma. \nPathways is an emergency shelter in Lynnwood serving adults aged 18 and older and parents with children who are experiencing homelessness. Many of the individuals and families we serve arrive with generational histories of poverty, addiction, domestic violence, homelessness, and trauma. Prior to entry, families may have been living in vehicles, recently evicted, or fleeing unsafe situations. Children often have high Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) scores and are particularly vulnerable. \nAt Pathways, each family receives a private room and works with a dedicated YWCA advocate to create a Housing Stability Plan. The shelter provides connections to housing navigation, financial assistance, legal aid, education, early childhood services, and advocacy. Pathways meets immediate needs while helping families move toward long-term stability.\nHomeward House supports new and expectant parents who are facing substance use disorders and related challenges, including poverty, homelessness, and the risk or reality of involvement by Child Protective Services. Participants are navigating the child welfare system and/or are at high risk of parent/child separation and working toward permanent reunification with their children or avoiding the child welfare system altogether where possible. Through trauma-informed peer support, a centralized family visitation and resource center, and wrap-around services integrated with YWCA’s extensive network of community-based programs, Homeward House helps families remain safely together and supports long-term recovery.\nBoth programs reflect YWCA’s trauma-informed approach and deep commitment to family-centered care.
